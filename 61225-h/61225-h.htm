<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ABOARD THE GREEK POWERBOAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“This old Greek powerboat seems to be making
pretty fair time, isn’t it, Amos?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is, Jack, which fact gives me a
whole lot of solid satisfaction, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for us the water happens to be fairly
smooth this spring. They say the Ægean Sea
can kick up a lively circus when it takes the
notion.”</p>

<p>“The old stories told of the Greek mariners
prove that. You know, Jack, we’re fairly surrounded
by places that have been made famous
in ancient history.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Amos, and I reckon the Straits
of the Dardanelles, that in the days of Leander
used to be called the Hellespont, is one of the
most noted sheets of water in the wide world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, dozens of old-time cities like ancient
Troy were situated around the Sea of Marmora.
The Persians crossed the straits when they tried
so hard to conquer brave little Macedonia and
Thrace. Then there was Alexander the Great,
who led his wonderful army into Asia by the
same route. I guess you could talk for hours
about the thrilling events that have taken place
along the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>“And now, Amos, to think that in these modern
days the Turk is ably defending the water
road to Constantinople against his one-time
friends and backers, the British and
French.</p>

<p>“Times have changed, Amos, and I reckon
the Turk is on his way to scuttle out of Europe
at last. He came from Asia, you know. Constantinople
wasn’t founded by the followers of
Mahomet, but taken as a prize of war.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Amos, “I only hope that this
time we’ll be lucky enough to find my brother
Frank. We’ve made two attempts back in Belgium
and France, and arrived just in time to<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
learn he had been sent to other fields where
skilled airmen were badly needed.”</p>

<p>“Three is often the lucky number, Amos, and
somehow I’ve got a hunch that this time we’re
bound to run across your brother, who has done
such good work for the Allies.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Jack, I certainly hope so; and one
thing sure, I’ll never forget the splendid way
you’ve shared my fortunes, no matter how dark
they seemed. You’re a cousin and a chum in a
million.”</p>

<p>“Forget all that, please, Amos. I’m straining
my eyes through this glass in hopes of picking
up some sign of land ahead beyond that island
yonder; or perhaps seeing the smudge of smoke
from the Allies’ battleships on the hazy horizon.
Here, take a look, and let me know if you can
make out anything.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it might be just as well, while the two
manly-looking American lads on board the big
Greek powerboat are thus engaged, to go a little
into details, and explain who they are. It is
necessary, also, that the reader know what<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
strange mission took them into the dangerous
waters of the Mediterranean while the world war
was in progress.</p>

<p>Of course, those readers who have had the
privilege of enjoying the two previous volumes
of this series<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> do not need an introduction to
Jack and Amos, since they have already followed
the pair through many extraordinary adventures
when near the firing line in Belgium and Northern
France.</p>

<p>There are, however, doubtless others who are
making the acquaintance of the two chums for
the first time in these pages, and for their sake a
brief explanation is necessary.</p>

<p>Amos Turner and Jack Maxfield were not only
related through ties of blood, being cousins, but
for a long time they had been the most devoted
of chums. Blue-eyed Jack had spent some time
on a Western ranch, and learned many things
there through actual experience that his friend
knew only in theory, although Amos had been<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
for some time interested in the Boy Scout movement.</p>

<p>The boy with the dark eyes lived near Chicago,
and his father, Colonel Rodney Turner, was
known as an ex-military man whose book on
tactics had been used throughout the English-speaking
world. The stern martinet had traveled
extensively, and in this way became personally
acquainted with a number of soldiers of world-wide
reputation.</p>

<p>There was an older brother, Frank Bradford
Turner, a bright boy, but inclined at one time to
be wild (and was sometimes called Tom, a nickname
of early days). When the old gentleman
missed a pocketbook, which he remembered distinctly
of having placed in a desk drawer where
he kept his papers, he fully believed Frank had
given way to temptation and taken it.</p>

<p>The boy had simply denied ever seeing it, but
the circumstances were so very suspicious that it
ended in a quarrel, and his being sent away from
home.</p>

<p>Frank had not been seen by any one for several<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
years, and must have grown to manhood, for he
was ten years older than Amos.</p>

<p>Then, one day, an astonishing discovery was
made in the Turner home. The drawer of the
Colonel’s desk became wedged, and, being now
in failing health, he called in Amos to get it out,
and oil the edges so it might work smoother.</p>

<p>Amos, discovering that one or two papers had
been dragged off the top of the pile in taking
the drawer out, thrust his hand into the cavity
to capture them, and immediately held up the
long-missing pocketbook. It had fallen off in
opening the drawer, and was never stolen
after all.</p>

<p>Remorse began immediately to gnaw at the
old soldier’s heart. He called himself all manner
of names, and was suffering keenly, under
the belief that he would now never see his oldest
born again.</p>

<p>It was learned, through accident, that Frank
had traveled in African wilds with a noted explorer.
Then, later on, in England, he had taken
to aviation, and made a practical air pilot of himself.<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
They even discovered that he had offered
his services to the British Government at the outbreak
of hostilities, and was even then engaged
in his hazardous calling somewhere along the
front.</p>

<p>Since the Colonel himself was in too feeble a
state of health to think of going across the ocean
to look for his wronged boy, Amos proposed that
he and Jack undertake the sacred duty. And so
they started, well supplied with money, and bearing
besides a letter to General Kitchener, who
had been, at one time, while in Egypt, a great
friend of Colonel Turner, a man whose system of
tactics he admired highly.</p>

<p>Meeting the “man of destiny,” upon whom
England was placing most of her faith in this
terrible crisis, the boys had no difficulty in securing
from him a paper that later on smoothed
over many difficulties they chanced to encounter
while in the fighting zone.</p>

<p>Dozens of times they had made petty officials
stare when they saw what a strong endorsement
these American lads carried. Often men high in<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
military authority had virtually made a salute at
sight of the letter actually penned by Kitchener
of Khartoum, whose name was a sign manual
wherever men wore the khaki of the British
army, as well as the Territorials, as the men from
Canada, Australia and New Zealand were called.</p>

<p>After encountering many perils, all of which
have been entertainingly described in previous
pages, the boys had actually hit upon a strong
clue. They heard about the astonishingly daring
work of an Allied aviator named Frank Bradford,
who, besides other feats, had made a long
flight up into the Rhine country and severely
damaged some ammunition stores and works of
the Germans, returning in safety through dangers
without limit.</p>

<p>The more the two lads investigated and asked
questions the more firmly Amos became convinced
that this Frank Bradford, winning fame
as the most skillful of all the Allied air pilots,
could be no other than his long-missing brother.
For some reason of his own, Frank had chosen
to be known by only a portion of his real name;<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
but the descriptions tallied with the remembrance
Amos had of his brother.</p>

<p>They had followed the trail from Belgium over
into Northern France, and had high hopes of
coming upon the object of their long search
there; but only met with still another disappointment.
Aviators were sorely needed in the region
of the Dardanelles, where the Allied fleet was
trying to force a passage through the narrow
channel that led to the Sea of Marmora, and
Constantinople. This peninsula was being desperately
defended by an army of Turks, officered
by hundreds of expert Germans, and with scores
of forts and batteries to hold the assailants in
check.</p>

<p>Frank had just a short time before started for
the East, and thither, as soon as they could get
aboard a steamer at Boulogne, the two boys followed
him. They touched at Italy, and from
there managed to get to a seaport in Greece,
where the real difficulties of the undertaking
began to confront them.</p>

<p>Just when they were ready to give up all hope<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
of finding a chance to take passage on any sort
of boat, and were even contemplating trying to
purchase a small naphtha launch of some sort,
they learned that a large powerboat was starting
for some Turkish port. The commander, who
went under the name of Captain Zenos, agreed
to take them somewhere near the scene of operations,
when they could find some way of getting
in touch with British Headquarters, and learning
what they wished to know about Frank
Bradford.</p>

<p>They had been for some time passing cautiously
among the numerous islands of the famous
Ægean Sea, and were heading for the Gallipoli
Peninsula that lies between it and the heavily
fortified Dardanelles Straits.</p>

<p>After using the glass which his chum had
handed him, Amos declared that it began to look
as though they might be heading for the island
mentioned.</p>

<p>“We are, by this time,” he went on to say,
“getting somewhere near our destination, and,
since we have paid in advance, I’ve been wondering<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
whether the captain might not mean to land
us at any old place, just to get rid of us.”</p>

<p>Jack glanced around before replying, as though
to make certain there was no chance of his being
overheard. At the time it happened that the
crew of seven dark-faced and brawny Greeks
were engaged in doing something up forward,
under the supervision of their captain, so that
Jack felt perfectly free to speak what he had on
his mind.</p>

<p>“I’ve been meaning to mention a certain matter
for some time, Amos, and it strikes me there’s
no use holding it back any longer,” he said, half
under his breath.</p>

<p>“Is it about Captain Zenos, Jack?” immediately
demanded the other, who doubtless must
have noticed the cautious look his companion
gave toward the skipper and rough crew of the
big powerboat that was churning the water so
noisily.</p>

<p>“Just what it is,” came the immediate reply.
“To tell you the honest truth, Amos, I don’t like
the man’s looks any too well. He watches us<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
from time to time as if he meant to play us some
sort of mean trick. We must keep our eyes open,
or something not down on the bills may happen
to us pretty soon.”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE GUN RUNNER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“But what do you think of the grizzled old
chap?” asked Amos, managing to snatch a look
at the skipper as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I can give only a guess at the most,” admitted
Jack. “These Greeks have always been good
sailors and regular water-dogs. You know how
we have read about their exploits in ancient history.
Scylla and Charybdis, the rock and the
whirlpool, were among their most feared enemies,
not to speak of the mermaids, who combed
their long hair and sang to the sailors, trying to
entice them to drop overboard and make love to
them. As for Captain Zenos, I’m afraid he’s
something of a bold adventurer.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought, myself, he had the free-and-easy
look of a regular buccaneer, with those rings
in his ears, and that red handkerchief about his
head,” said Amos. “As long as he carried out<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
his contract with us I made up my mind it was
really no business of ours, even if he turned out
to be a pirate.”</p>

<p>“But watch him look over this way every little
while, and you’ll feel that he’s got us on his mind.
I think, Amos, he’s concluded we’re English boys,
and, as some of these Greek sailors are apt to be
hand in glove with the Turks, perhaps he may
be plotting to hand us over to the enemy, expecting
to profit thereby.”</p>

<p>“Whew! I wonder now!” whiffed Amos, as
though the idea rather staggered him.</p>

<p>“Of course, as I said before, it’s pretty much
all guess work with me,” Jack repeated, “but I’ve
been fairly successful in reading faces. Honestly,
if you asked me what I thought of our skipper,
I’d say he might be a man who would turn on
his best friend, if the pay was big enough.”</p>

<p>“I wish we knew the truth,” muttered Amos.
“We might do something to put a peg in his nice
little game. Each of us is carrying a shooting-iron
now, for self-defense, even though we decided
not to go armed when near the firing line,<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
for fear of being roughly handled in case we
fell into the hands of the Germans, as almost
happened several times.”</p>

<p>“We must keep on our guard and watch out
for treachery,” said Jack. “This happens to be
one of those times when ‘an ounce of prevention
is better than a pound of cure.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll match your proverb with another
when I say that ‘forewarned is forearmed.’
If that old chap wants to get the better of two
wide-awake American boys like us he must rise
pretty early in the morning, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Amos. I was just wondering what
sort of a cargo they have down below.”</p>

<p>“Well, up to this minute, I’ve never bothered
my head about that part of it,” admitted the
other. “All I knew was that it’s carefully covered
over with tarpaulins, so that the water can’t
get at it. I took it for granted they were carrying
bags of flour, or something in the way of
food, to Smyrna, and would fetch back figs or
oranges, or some other fruit grown around
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“It might turn out we’d be able to get a line
on Captain Zenos if only we knew what his cargo
consisted of,” suggested Jack, softly yet significantly.</p>

<p>Amos started, and looked into his chum’s blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Ginger! does that mean you suspect him of
being what might be called a blockade runner?”
he asked in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>“Something along those lines,” asserted Jack.
“Look him over again and tell me if you could
ever imagine a better specimen of a daring adventurer.
Doesn’t his every movement and expression
say that Captain Zenos has spent the
better part of his life dodging customs officers
as a smuggler, or something like that?”</p>

<p>“Honest, Jack, I do believe you are right.
Now that you’ve mentioned it, I think of several
things I’ve noticed, and I agree with you. The
old Greek skipper has all the ear-marks of a bold
adventurer. The chances are he’s as unscrupulous
as he is daring.”</p>

<p>“Then it strikes me we ought to be doing something<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
before it’s too late, so as to find out what
sort of a boat we’ve taken passage on,” Jack
suggested, quietly.</p>

<p>“By demanding that he tell us, do you mean?”
asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly,” came the reply. “That would
only hurry him along, I’m afraid. But there’s
another way to find out. I might watch my
chance and make an effort to see what lies under
those snug tarpaulins down below!”</p>

<p>Amos gave a slight whistle, which was one of
his customary ways of indicating surprise.</p>

<p>“Not a bad scheme, Jack, sure it isn’t, only I
don’t see why you wouldn’t let me do the prowling
around.”</p>

<p>“It was my idea, and you must expect me to be
the one to do the job,” he was told, although at
the same time Jack favored him with a smile of
appreciation, for he knew just how willing Amos
always was to undertake any manner of task,
regardless of the labor involved or the peril that
threatened.</p>

<p>“If, as you suspect, they turn out to be blockade<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
runners, Jack, perhaps they mean to hide behind
that island yonder until dark comes on,
when they can slip past the torpedo-boat lines,
and land their stuff.”</p>

<p>“As like as not,” agreed Jack. “As there’s no
time to be lost, I reckon I might slip my cable
right now while they’re all so busy up forward,
and see if it’s possible to get a line on that mysterious
cargo.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to you then,” Amos told him.
“But before you go, give me some idea of what
you want me to do in case I learn the captain
suspects you and acts.”</p>

<p>“I hope that isn’t going to happen,” said Jack.
“It would precipitate a crisis. I’d rather wait
until it gets dark, when we might manage to slip
the boat loose they are towing behind, and get
to the land in it.”</p>

<p>“But what if discovery <em>does</em> come about?” persisted
Amos.</p>

<p>“In that case there’s only one thing for you
to do,” explained Jack; “stop the captain from
coming down on top of me, even if you have to<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
cover him with your gun. Then give our old
signal, and I’ll be alongside in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll remember, though, like you, I
certainly hope he won’t notice your absence, or,
if he does, he may think you’ve just stepped back
in the little cabin for something. I say that, to
tell you the honest truth, I don’t like the idea of
trying to offstand that ferocious sea-dog. He
might rush me, and then I’d have to pull trigger,
you know. So-long, Jack. Be back as soon as
you can.”</p>

<p>“You may depend on that,” he was told, and
with that Jack disappeared.</p>

<p>Amos continued to stand there, using the
glass, and, occasionally, when he thought the
skipper might be looking his way, he would turn
and speak as though conversing with his chum,
who apparently was lying down and beyond the
range of Captain Zenos’ vision.</p>

<p>It was really very cleverly arranged by Amos,
and did him much credit. Possibly only for this
scheme he put into play the skipper may have
become suspicious and advanced toward him to<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
learn where Jack had gone to, which act would
have precipitated a crisis.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed.</p>

<p>Amos had become intensely interested in a
black smudge which, through his powerful
binoculars, he had just discovered on the horizon.
He found himself wondering what kind of vessel
was leaving that low trail of smoke behind it.
Was it a dreadnaught carrying the British Union
Jack or just a transport bearing more forces of
the Allies to help beat a way through the rock-bound
strait that barred the route to Constantinople?</p>

<p>The captain and crew were still engaged forward,
though occasionally the former would
think to glance in the direction where his young
passenger stood, glass in hand. Amos never
forgot to carry out his scheme and make
a great show of speaking to some one
close by.</p>

<p>He had reason to believe that the little game
quite deceived the skipper, for, to the boy’s relief,
Captain Zenos made no effort to approach him<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
on some plea or other, but really to investigate.</p>

<p>Why was Jack so long, Amos asked himself,
and then decided it was his own impatience that
made the seconds seem like minutes. Jack had
to proceed with a due amount of caution; and,
having accomplished his purpose, he might be
expected back at any time now.</p>

<p>Even as Amos told himself this he heard a
slight movement behind him, and, turning, discovered
his chum. The first thing that struck
him as particularly suggestive was the sober
look on Jack’s face.</p>

<p>“He has found something out, that’s sure,”
Amos told himself, with a sensation akin to a
shiver running over his system; but it was the
thrill of excitement and not fear that caused him
to grit his teeth in expectancy.</p>

<p>In another minute Jack was beside him again.</p>

<p>“Give me the glass, and be pointing something
out,” said the latter. “He’s watching us. Yes, I
can see that smoke low down on the horizon; and
the chances are it’s made by a British battleship
going to or coming from the island where we<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
understand they do all their repairs after being
struck and damaged.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out anything?” asked the eager
Amos.</p>

<p>“I sure did,” he was told.</p>

<p>“And the cargo they’ve got hidden under the
canvas tarpaulins, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Consists of guns and ammunition, as well as
big shells, Amos! Fact is, we’re aboard a gun
runner carrying arms to the Turks!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_27" class="pagenum">[27]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE THREATENING PERIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The importance of the news rather staggered
Amos. He held his breath for nearly half a
minute before venturing to say anything.</p>

<p>“That sounds pretty lively, take it from me,
Jack. Guns and shells, you say, for the Turks on
Gallipoli Peninsula?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s much ammunition besides,
powder and rifle cartridges. They must be using
those up at a terribly rapid rate,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“If a lighted match happened to be thrown
carelessly under that lot of tarpaulins, an explosion
would follow, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I guess what’s passing through that rapid-fire
brain of yours, Amos, but unless we’re attacked
we really have no right to do anything as
serious as that. You must remember that we’re
neutral in this war.”</p>

<p>“Huh! we may be so far as the Germans and<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
Austrians are concerned,” grumbled Amos, “but
it’s a different thing with the Turks. Every
hand in Europe has at times been raised against
them. England saved them from being kicked
out of Constantinople more than once. And
when I see British and French soldiers scrapping
with the dark-skinned Turk, I’m just <em>bound</em> to
take sides, no matter what anybody says.”</p>

<p>“It must be in the blood,” admitted Jack.
“Like father, like son, and after all you’ve got
the soldier’s instinct handed down to you.”</p>

<p>“But tell me, Jack, if you’ve guessed it by now,
why should the Greeks want to send all this ammunition
over there, when the chances are before
long they’ll be in the swim, too, and with the
Allies as side partners?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it isn’t the Greeks as a people who do
this underhand business,” the other explained.
“You’ll always find some men ready to take risks
when they see a big profit in the gun-running
game. You know, Germany hasn’t been able to
get as much ammunition across Roumania and
Bulgaria as the Turks need; and so some of the<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
German secret agents in Greece have organized
a regular fleet of these big powerboats to carry
cargoes through the lines of the Allies.”</p>

<p>“If they’re held up it would be a bad job for
the skippers I reckon, Jack?”</p>

<p>“No question about it. They might be
stood against a wall and shot.”</p>

<p>“But if the captain had this big game up his
sleeve,” questioned Amos, who always wanted an
explanation, “why should he bother taking a
couple of American boys aboard, and perhaps
spoil his other work?”</p>

<p>“The big sum we offered tempted him in the
first place, I suppose,” explained Jack. “Then,
with a crew of seven men, not counting himself,
he took it for granted they could do what they
liked with us.”</p>

<p>“You mean chuck us ashore on some measly
little island in this Ægean Sea, to be marooned,
goodness knows for how long?” suggested
Amos.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that was the plan, and the island
ahead of us the place selected for carrying out<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
the plot. But Amos, for all we know he may
have figured on taking us as prisoners ashore on
the Peninsula, and handing us over to the Turks
as English boys.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you say!” grumbled Amos, shaking
his head, upset by the thought. “If I felt
sure he had that idea passing through his head,
I’d say we ought to do something to foil his
plans, and right away in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve evolved a scheme that may give us
the boat,” was the staggering remark made by
Jack. It fairly took Amos’ breath away.</p>

<p>“Then let me hear it, please, Jack. They’re
still working in the bow there, and we’ve got
some time to ourselves. The man at the wheel
keeps us heading in the direction of that island,
and it’s got something to do with their plans.
They mean to either drop us ashore there and
maroon us, or else lie to behind until the night
wears on, when they can slip past the guard line
of patrol boats.”</p>

<p>“When I was down below,” explained Jack, “it
struck me what a commotion there would be<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
aboard if smoke was suddenly discovered coming
up out of the hold!”</p>

<p>“Oh! my stars! I should say so!” gasped
Amos, looking startled. “If, as you say, the
cargo is made up of high explosives, we would
be shot up into the clouds, and none of us would
ever know what had happened. But are you
thinking of blowing up the old boat, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” was the reply, “but it
might answer the same purpose if we could make
the crew believe they were in danger of being
scattered to the four winds. I think most of
them would jump overboard and start swimming
for the island we’re getting so close to.”</p>

<p>Amos began to chuckle. Evidently the humorous
side of the thing struck him fully.</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t that be a great joke though,
Jack, if we could scare the bunch into abandoning
the boat! Why, what would hinder us from
running it, and in the end turning the stuff over
to the Allies?”</p>

<p>“You like the idea, then, do you?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a jolly good scheme, let me tell you, if
only it could be worked out,” Amos assented&mdash;not
doubtfully, either, for he had infinite faith
in anything his chum attempted to do.</p>

<p>“Leave that part of it to me, Amos. I know
just how I can fix things so that in a short time
smoke, heavy, black smoke, will ooze out of the
hold, though there’ll not be the least danger of
an explosion.”</p>

<p>“Then, Jack, since we’ve decided that it’s a
case of biting or being bitten, please get busy as
quick as you can. I’m fairly wild to see what
happens when that smoke is discovered. We
must act as if we’re half frightened to death,
even if we’re not supposed to know the nature of
the cargo under our feet.”</p>

<p>Jack took another look around him. The
island came in for a considerable share of his
attention, for if there was to be a sudden exodus
of captain and crew belonging to the powerboat,
that was the only place to which they could go.</p>

<p>The afternoon was near its end and already
the shades of approaching night had commenced<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
to creep forth. He could see some slender masts
outlined against the sky-line above one part of
the land, and concluded there must be a small
bay there, possibly a Greek village, and in which
shelter from the storms that sweep the Mediterranean
in the spring season of the year, these
small fishing boats might be safe from damage.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cautioned Amos.</p>

<p>Both of them strained their ears to catch the
distant grumble as of thunder that came over
the water.</p>

<p>“It seems to come from the northeast, as near
as I can make it out,” remarked Jack, presently.</p>

<p>“It must be the sound of the monster guns of a
dreadnaught engaging some of the Turkish batteries
or forts along the Dardanelles,” ventured
the second lad.</p>

<p>“As like as not we’re listening to the sixteen-inch
guns carried by the super-dreadnaught
<em>Queen Elizabeth</em>,” admitted Jack. “I forget how
many dozen miles they claim you can hear the
sound, but it’s a long ways. Mark the location
well, Amos.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” added the other, with a wide
smile, “because if later on we do the piloting of
this craft we’ll want to know our course, so as to
strike the line of guard-ships off the end of the
Gallipoli Peninsula.”</p>

<p>They stood and listened as the strange complaining
grumble came stealing again over the
swelling sea. Perhaps, in that moment, both boys
could see, in imagination, the great battleship
wreathed in smoke after the discharge of a monster
gun. Somehow the very thought thrilled
them, for they had been anticipating just such a
sight as this for some time now.</p>

<p>“Well, we may never have another chance as
good as this,” remarked Jack, presently, in a
singularly calm voice, which showed how completely
he had control of his nerves; “so, perhaps,
I’d better be ‘making hay while the sun shines.’”</p>

<p>“You’re away off there, Jack, because the sun
has dropped behind the level horizon, and there’s
only a glow to tell where he vanished. I’ll stand
guard here and see that no one surprises you at
work. But for the life of me I can’t guess how<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
you’re going to make smoke, and run no danger
of fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s easy,” chuckled Jack. “I’ve made
too many a smudge to keep the skeeters off when
in the open not to know the ropes. Just wait
and see what happens.”</p>

<p>He was gone almost as soon as he had spoken
the last word, and once more Amos began to
sweep the horizon with his binoculars, as though
eager to pick up some distant spot that would
prove to be a vessel. It was becoming more and
more difficult to make anything out, on account
of the haze that extended with the coming of
evening; but as we know, the main object Amos
had in mind was to deceive the skipper, whenever
he glanced that way.</p>

<p>Fainter grew the glow in the western sky.
The far-off booming had also died away, so the
only sounds that reached his ear consisted of the
loud voice of the Greek captain berating his men
for not doing something as he wished it.</p>

<p>Jack had been gone some little time, and Amos
began to worry about him. It would really be<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
too bad if, after all, the plan which he had considered
so brilliant should be ruined by a sudden
movement on the part of the skipper. They were
nearly through their job, whatever it was, and
the captain as well as the man who attended
to all the cooking were likely to approach Amos.</p>

<p>If they saw Jack come up out of the hold they
would instantly guess he had been prying around
down there and making discoveries that had not
been intended for the eyes of the two young
passengers.</p>

<p>“Gee! I wish he would hurry,” Amos kept
saying to himself, as he shifted his weight from
one foot to the other, then looked around to see
if Captain Zenos was observing him, and upon
finding that it was so, immediately pointed off
somewhere as though showing his chum some
object the glass had brought to his attention.</p>

<p>Just when Amos was giving up all hope of
their being able to carry out the little scheme,
once more he heard a rustling sound close by,
and knew that Jack had crawled up out of the
open hatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately this gap could not be seen by those
forward, nor was the man at the wheel able to
keep his eye upon it, thanks to a stack of empty
crates that were possibly being returned to fruit
shippers around Smyrna&mdash;at least that was what
the boys had been told, though they now believed
it to be a mere subterfuge calculated to divert
suspicion from the real errand of the big Greek
powerboat.</p>

<p>Jack was breathing hard as though he had
rushed matters somewhat. Amos felt glad to
have his chum once more at his right hand, for
he had come to depend on the executive ability
of Jack more than ever of late.</p>

<p>“Is the train laid, you black conspirator?” he
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and given five minutes more you’ll see
it come up with a rush,” he was told by Jack.</p>

<p>“All I can say is that you beat the Dutch when
it comes to arranging things like this. And, Jack,
whether the skipper comes back here or not
doesn’t matter much any more, does it?”</p>

<p>“I think that’s just what is going to happen<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
before many minutes,” announced the late hard
worker, as he wiped his forehead, as the evening
was warm. “Come, while we have half a chance,
let’s move further away from the hatch. I’d
like to be well off when the discovery is made that
the boat’s afire!”</p>

<p>“Whew! I bet there’s going to be a whole lot
of excitement around here to the square inch
before long,” muttered Amos. “I’m going to
whoop it up good and hearty too, when the row
begins. The more noise we make the bigger will
be the scare, it strikes me.”</p>

<p>They managed to edge along a little at a time,
when no one was looking, so that presently they
were able to come to a stand further away from
the open hatch, from the edge of the <a id="Ref_38"></a>coaming of
which the cargo, covered with heavy tarpaulins,
could be seen below.</p>

<p>“They’re making a move now, as if they meant
to scatter,” reported Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the captain together with the cook
have started this way,” Jack ventured. “Look
for something not down on the bills to happen at<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
any second, for I reckon my smudge is about due
to show itself all at once.”</p>

<p>Amos tried hard to suppress his feelings. He
was afraid those keen orbs of the old Greek
skipper might read the secret in his glowing eyes,
so he once again clapped the glasses up to his
face and appeared to be scanning the sea beyond
the nearby island as though in search of something.</p>

<p>Still he knew when the captain and the
cook drew near the spot where he and his chum
stood. If only the discovery might be made just
at that critical moment, Amos believed it would
count for a good deal more than if they were
forced to call out a little later and bring the
skipper on deck.</p>

<p>All at once he heard a loud outcry. It was the
cook who uttered it, and as the two boys turned
quickly to see what he meant they discovered the
sailor pointing toward the open hatch, his whole
manner telling of sudden fear.</p>

<p>Then the boys whirled around to see what had
so startled the sailor, who knew the explosive<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
character of the cargo in the hold, since not even
a lighted pipe had been allowed near the opening.</p>

<p>Well, Jack’s plan had apparently worked all
right, for out of the hold rolled a curling billow
of black smoke. How Jack had contrived to
create all this Amos could not for the life of him
understand; nor was that the time or place to
ask questions. He simply remembered what he
had said his plan would be, and at sight of that
column of smoke he let out a yell that would have
shamed some of those wild cowboy friends with
whom Jack, mounted on half-tamed bronchos,
once upon a time had been wont to race over the
plains.</p>

<span id="Page_41" class="pagenum">[41]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HOW THE TRICK WORKED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Fire! Fire!” whooped Amos, showing the
most intense excitement, for if there was any
chance to add to the confusion of the moment he
meant to do it.</p>

<p>He had but one object in view, which was to
so fill the Greek crew with consternation that
they would, to a man, leap overboard, and leave
the apparently doomed vessel to their erstwhile
passengers.</p>

<p>The plan began immediately to show signs of
bearing fruit. As has been said before, the crew
knew full well what sort of a dangerous cargo
they were carrying. High explosives have a
habit of going off when brought in contact with
a tongue of flame. When, therefore, they saw
the black smoke pouring out of the hold their
first thought was that, in a few seconds, there
would come a terrific crash, and the powerboat<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
would be scattered in atoms over the surface of
the sea.</p>

<p>Their loud cries of alarm rang out, as the boys
had anticipated. One who by some chance was
close to the rail instantly plunged overboard,
vanishing under the water like a stone, and
doubtless bent on keeping there as long as he
could hold his breath, meanwhile swimming
desperately away from the still moving
craft.</p>

<p>A second and yet a third man saw him go, and
evidently thought that the only way out of the
fix, for they started to imitate his example.</p>

<p>Not so the skipper, who was evidently made of
different stuff. The boys in commenting on his
determined looks had not guessed far from
wrong when they decided that Captain Zenos was
a reckless customer who had run many a blockade
for the sake of gain, just as he was now
trying to get guns and ammunition to the sorely
pressed Turks on Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>

<p>He saw the smoke just as soon as the rest of
the crew, but instead of thinking of his safety,<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
the old sea dog’s first idea was to try and
save the boat and cargo, even at great personal
risk.</p>

<p>What he shouted in his lion-like voice the boys
did not know, not being proficient Greek scholars.
They could give a pretty good guess, however,
that he was roaring out orders to his men to follow
him into the hold and try to put out the fire
that had so mysteriously broken out when they
were off their guard.</p>

<p>He made direct for the open hatch from which
that dense smoke oozed. Three men followed on
his heels, being possibly the possessors of the
same reckless nature as himself, or else descendants
of those old-time Spartans who would obey
orders from their superiors blindly, no matter
if they had to charge into the very jaws of
death.</p>

<p>Jack was observing all this with the most intense
interest. He even noted that the man at
the wheel stuck to his duty. From this fact he
supposed the skipper had not forgotten him when
roaring out his orders, and that he had been<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
directed to stay where he was, come what may.</p>

<p>There were three in the water by now, and
doubtless all making desperately for the nearby
shore of the island, anxious to put many fathoms
between themselves and the doomed craft before
the terrible explosion came.</p>

<p>Captain Zenos snatched up a bucket that stood
near. Leaning over the rail he flung it downward
and once more he drew it up filled to the
brim with salt water.</p>

<p>Each of the three sailors followed his example
with exact precision, like men who knew the
value of obedience in an emergency. By this
time the skipper had reached the open hatch.
<a id="Ref_44"></a>That dense smoke showed no signs of abating;
in fact, if anything, it was oozing forth in
greater volume than ever, thanks to Jack’s clever
arrangements below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="449" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">That dense smoke showed no signs of abating.&mdash;<em><a href="#Ref_44">Page 44</a></em></p></div>
</div>

<p>One last look the valiant skipper gave around,
as if to make sure that his crew had not entirely
deserted him. Then without the slightest hesitation
he plunged into the opening and vanished
from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>Jack and Amos could not repress cries of sincere
admiration. If they had from some instinctive
reason disliked the battle-scarred old veteran
of the blockade and gun-running game, they now
admired his great nerve. Evidently, with all his
faults, and they were many, Captain Zenos could
never be accused of cowardice.</p>

<p>One, two, three figures took the drop after
him, not one of the trio showing the slightest
hesitation. Perhaps these men had long been
associated with the owner of the big powerboat,
and imbibed a full share of his daring.</p>

<p>The tail-end man did take a look around before
dropping out of sight, and Jack imagined he felt
he might be saying good-by to the bright world,
for it certainly did seem as though the chances
were ten to one they might never come forth
again.</p>

<p>As far as it went this was all very fine. Three
were in the water madly racing for the shore of
the island; another trio had accompanied the
leader below; and the last member of the crew
stood by the wheel, though the speed of the boat<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
had been reduced until she was now beginning to
pass but slowly through the twilight sea.</p>

<p>But Jack realized that as soon as those groping
through the dense smoke below found that its
source lay in a galvanized bucket, and that the
smudge had apparently been created for some
distinct purpose, their suspicions would be immediately
aroused.</p>

<p>Since they would speedily come pouring forth
as furious as could be and turn upon the two
boys for an explanation of the trick, it was up
to Jack and Amos to prevent such an unhappy
consummation.</p>

<p>“The hatch&mdash;we must clap it on, and batten
the same down!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he was jumping toward the
smoke cloud, with Amos close at his heels. What
few words Jack had spoken revealed the plan
of campaign to his comrade, who was only too
ready to assist in the deal.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel must have stared hard
at seeing the two boys thus start forward instead
of jumping overboard like those others had<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
done. Perhaps he even gave them credit for the
same species of sublime courage that the skipper
possessed. When, presently, he saw what they
were doing, astonishment kept him from trying
to interfere until it was too late to do any
good.</p>

<p>Seizing hold of the heavy hatch, the two boys
managed to throw it into place. There was
means for securing it so that even if great waves
swept over the low deck of the powerboat they
could hardly tear the hatch loose, and flood the
hold.</p>

<p>Thanks to his habit of observation, Jack knew
all about this, and also how the fastenings were
applied. Amos, taking his cue from his comrade,
also gave such assistance as lay in his power; and
between them they speedily managed to accomplish
their desired end.</p>

<p>Hardly had they succeeded in doing this than
there came heavy pounding on the other side of
the hatch. Evidently the skipper had learned
how he had been made the victim of what he
would call a “scurvy trick”; and was fairly wild<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
to force a way out of the hold, so that he could
punish those responsible for it.</p>

<p>Jack had not forgotten the man at the wheel,
who had it in his power, should the inclination
come to him, to injure the engine of the boat in
some way, so as to prevent any further progress.</p>

<p>As this would be greatly to the disadvantage
of the two comrades, Jack did not mean to permit
the man to have the least chance of carrying
out his intention.</p>

<p>Leaving Amos standing by the battened hatch,
pistol in hand, Jack rushed straight toward the
man at the wheel. He covered him with his
weapon, and, under the belief that the fellow
knew English, for he had conversed with several
of the crew before then, the boy called out
sternly:</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, and hold the wheel, and
no injury will come to you. There is no fire and
we will not be blown up. It was a trick to get
the captain down in the hold. He is our prisoner,
and we expect to run this boat from now on.
Do you understand what I am saying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>The sailor looked a little dazed as though
events were happening with such wonderful
rapidity that he could hardly keep track of them.
Still he seemed to be able to understand English,
especially when accompanied by the significant
gestures Jack was making with the little automatic
pistol.</p>

<p>He immediately elevated his right hand. That
was doubtless intended to show his willingness
to submit to whatever fate the daring captors
of the powerboat felt inclined to impose upon
him.</p>

<p>“Start up the engine again and keep it going
full speed!” was the first order the new skipper
gave the pilot.</p>

<p>Presently the boat began to pick up, as the propeller
churned the water. It felt good to Amos,
standing there and listening to the terrific
pounding on the lower side of the hatch. He
took off his hat and waved it about his head as
he gave a loud, boyish hurrah that came from
the depths of his heart.</p>

<p>No doubt that organ was pounding against his<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
ribs with the furious energy of a trip-hammer;
but apparently the danger point had been safely
passed, and they had a free course open before
them.</p>

<p>The three men who jumped overboard had
meanwhile managed to reach shallow water.
They were standing, up to their waists in the sea,
at what they considered a safe distance from the
powerboat, staring at the now moving craft as
though unable to believe their eyes.</p>

<p>The smoke had ceased coming up from the
hold as soon as the hatch was clapped on, and,
with the starting of the engine, the boat showed
signs of leaving the unfortunate trio in the lurch&mdash;at
least they must have considered themselves
in a bad box at the time, though later developments
proved that they were exceedingly fortunate.</p>

<p>Loud rang out their shouts as they made all
sorts of wild gestures, imploring their companions
not to desert them. Perhaps the simple fellows,
not aware of the dramatic acts that were
taking place aboard the boat, imagined the skipper<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
meant to discipline them for deserting when
there was need of their services.</p>

<p>Amos waved his hand hilariously toward the
three. He was feeling in a merry mood. The
bright scheme which Jack originated had turned
out so successful!</p>

<p>One look gave Jack his course, and he impressed
it upon the pilot.</p>

<p>“We want to head straight as an arrow for the
Dardanelles,” he said sternly. “You will be all
right as long as you behave, but the first sign of
treachery and it means your end. Our lives are
at stake now and we will shoot you down like a
dog if you turn on us. We want to run across
some warship of the Allies, to whom this boat
and its cargo can be surrendered. And if you
behave we will guarantee that you are let go
free. Get that?”</p>

<p>The man had listened intently, watching every
gesture made by Jack. At the conclusion of the
short harangue he nodded his head and even
allowed a grim smile to flit athwart his dark face.
Being a daring chap himself he could admire an<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
exhibition of American pluck such as the two
boys were displaying. Anyone who managed to
get the better of a sly old sea-dog like Captain
Zenos must be pretty wide-awake, according to
his opinion.</p>

<p>“I play you the game straight, I promise you!”
he assured Jack, who, however, did not take his
word for it, knowing how treacherous some men
can be when conditions change; and he meant to
keep the Greek pilot under constant surveillance
until their plans had been fully carried out.</p>

</div>


<p>“What’s the next move on the program,
Jack?” asked Amos, as he hurried over to the
side of his chum, while the pounding on the hatch
kept up furiously.</p>

<p>“I’ve given the course to the man at the wheel,
and told him we will shoot at the first sign of
treachery,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me!” Amos declared.
“Do you think we can keep on into the night, and
come slap up against any of those war vessels?”</p>

<p>“I know the points of the compass,” he was
told. “I’ve also got a chart of this sea, as well
as the Dardanelles, so I don’t see why we
shouldn’t be able to keep up a straight course.
We know about where we’re headed, and I’m in
hopes of picking up the searchlight of some battleship
that is on the move to keep from being
torpedoed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“I’m willing to trust everything to you, Jack.
How about those chaps below decks? If they
should ever break loose there will be trouble right
away!”</p>

<p>“It’s a part of our business to make sure they
don’t break loose then,” the other remarked,
firmly. “I’m going to tell Captain Zenos something.
He’s got common-sense, I reckon, even if
he is a fire-eater.”</p>

<p>“All I’m afraid of is that he may take a crazy
notion to strike a match and blow up the boat
rather than surrender it,” said Amos, uneasily.</p>

<p>Even that prospect did not seem to alarm
steady-going Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” he told his companion. “Few
men ever deliberately sacrifice themselves in
order to bring about the downfall of others. In
forty-nine cases out of fifty a would-be assassin
of royalty takes precious good care to look out
for a safe getaway. That is what defeats their
plans so often.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right about that, Jack,” admitted
Amos. “I’ve read so along the same line.<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
They say that if a man is firmly decided to give
up his own life to the cause, all the precautions in
the wide world couldn’t prevent any ruler from
getting his finish.”</p>

<p>“Remember what we had last spring in our
history class about that general besieging ancient
Rome, and who had a young Roman brought before
him, caught in the camp. The youth told
him he was one of a hundred who had sworn to
take the life of the vandal general; and to show
his fearless nature, thrust his hand into a fire and
held it there until it was consumed.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I remember that,” said Amos, “and the
general, knowing that he was a doomed man if
he stayed around there much longer, with ninety-nine
other young Romans after his life, all built
on the same fearless model, soon found it convenient
to call off the siege and go home.”</p>

<p>“Well, after I’ve explained to Captain Zenos
that he will surely be given his liberty later on,
any intention of blowing up the boat he may be
entertaining will have passed away. Bold man
that he is, all the same he can believe that ‘he who<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
fights and runs away may live to fight another
day.’ Now, you stand here and watch our pilot
every second of the time, while I speak to the
skipper.”</p>

<p>Jack bent down when he reached the hatch.
The pounding continued, and was supplemented
by loud cries from the men below.</p>

<p>With a monkey-wrench he had picked up on
the way, Jack started to himself give a few powerful
blows upon the hatch. Immediately the
noise below ceased.</p>

<p>“Hello! Captain Zenos!” the boy called out,
knowing that the other could speak English as
well as his own native tongue, for he was a man
who had traveled over pretty much all the world.</p>

<p>“Who is that speaking?” he heard a grumbling
voice say.</p>

<p>“It is one of your passengers,” answered Jack.
“We have captured your vessel and part of your
crew has been left behind, having landed on the
island. The rest is below with you.”</p>

<p>“But who are you, and what does this mean?”
demanded the bewildered captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>“Just what we told you we are, two American
boys who are looking for some one who is with
the Allies at the Dardanelles,” Jack explained.</p>

<p>“Why have you done this?” continued the
prisoner of the hold.</p>

<p>“Because we believed you meant us harm, and
we decided to strike first. So I made the smudge
below in order to cause the crew to leap overboard
and abandon the craft. But you were too
brave a man to be frightened, and we had to shut
you down below or lose the game. I want to
make a bargain with you, Captain.”</p>

<p>The man waited some little time before replying.
Evidently he was trying to get a firm grip
on the conditions by which he was surrounded,
so that he could play his best card. Then he
called out again as though in anger.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I have a good mind to do,
boy? I have matches with me here, and the
powder can be easily reached. One match would
be enough to finish us all, and we could go into
glory together.”</p>

<p>“I understand that, Captain,” said Jack, coolly,<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
as though not a bit afraid the other would put
his threat into execution. “We are willing to
take our chances. You would be a fool to end
your life that way when you can live to enjoy
other exploits.”</p>

<p>“But if I fall into the hands of the British they
will surely shoot me!” urged the man below.</p>

<p>“I give you my word of honor that they will
let you and your men go free, on condition that
you do nothing to injure the boat or the cargo.
Is it a bargain, Captain Zenos? We are both
armed, and will hesitate at nothing, even should
you succeed in breaking loose, which we do not
mean to have happen. Be reasonable, and, after
all, you will lose only your boat. There are other
craft to be had for money, but no one can get a
second life, you know, if he loses the one he has.”</p>

<p>Jack heard the man actually laugh harshly.
He believed he had gone about it the right way to
get results.</p>

<p>“You are certainly a boy after my own heart,
and since there does not seem to be any other
thing to do, I agree to your terms,” the captain<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
called out. “Only I trust you will not deceive us.
If I thought I might be held as a prisoner of war,
or stood up to be shot, nothing would keep me
from striking a match and ending it all now.”</p>

<p>“I have given you my word of honor, Captain;
that is all I can do,” Jack told him, a little anxious
still, for he knew the man was a reckless blade,
and after all he might act on a sudden whim.</p>

<p>“Well, let it be a bargain then,” called the skipper;
“but I hope you will not keep us many hours
down in this hot hold. We would smother, I
fear.”</p>

<p>“Inside of a couple of hours we hope to run
across some war vessel, when you will be released
and allowed to enter the small boat to
make for the shore just as you please.”</p>

<p>Satisfied that he had accomplished the purpose
he had in view, Jack turned away. He knew
that those below could hardly break out of their
confinement within a certain length of time, at
least, and, while he did not mean to forget them,
he wished to turn his attention to another
quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>It was getting dark. The twilight had fled,
and it was no longer possible to see for any distance
over the heaving surface of the sea. The
island where the men had landed was far astern,
and looked like a dark blot amidst the gathering
gloom.</p>

<p>Glancing aloft, Jack could see the first stars
beginning to appear. He took his bearings in
this way, and as long as those heavenly lanterns
remained in sight there would be no fear of their
going astray. He had tramped many a time
across trackless wastes of land with only a star
to guide him; he felt the same confidence when
upon the sea.</p>

<p>“We must first of all see to the lights,” he
told Amos as he joined him. “With all these
dangers hanging over our heads it would be silly
to think of keeping in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Let me look after them,” said Amos. “I
watched the man who did the job last night, and
I think I’ve got it all down pat.”</p>

<p>“After you’ve finished with the lights, Amos,
it might be as well to rummage around and stir<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
up something to eat. I’m as hungry as a wolf.
There must be food aboard, of course.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for knowing where it’s kept,”
chuckled the other. “I never mean to be starved
to death if keeping my eyes wide open will prevent
it. Sure, there’s plenty of grub close by.
Watch me rustle it out when the time comes.”</p>

<p>He soon had the lanterns lighted; one hung to
show the figure of the helmsman as he stood
there at the wheel and guided the boat; and two
others, the one red and the other green, on either
side of the boat, so that they might not be run
down in the gloom of night.</p>

<p>After this had all been attended to, Amos, true
to his promise, washed his hands in the tin basin
so as to free them from the kerosene odor, and
then proceeded to produce all manner of food
from the cook’s little galley.</p>

<p>They made no attempt to cook anything, for
the conditions would not allow of their going to
such trouble. Hungry boys are as a rule not at
all particular about the quality of their food, so
long as the quantity is right; and not a single<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
complaint was made regarding that supper,
though it was crude in its appointments, and
eaten under strange surroundings.</p>

<p>Even the man at the wheel was remembered,
and thankfully received a portion of the simple
spread, which he proceeded to devour as though
he might be no longer troubling himself about
the immediate future.</p>

<p>“Now for a long and weary watch,” said
Amos, after only half an hour or more had
elapsed since the capture of the powerboat.</p>

<p>“It may not be as long as you think,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that, Jack? Is it just on
general principles, or have you some idea?”</p>

<p>“Well, we are making all of ten miles an hour,
it strikes me,” was the answer; “and when twice
that time has passed you can see we ought to be
somewhere near that battleship we heard firing.
Besides, I soon expect to catch sight of their
searchlights playing every-which-way.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jack,” admitted Amos, immediately
convinced. “When warships are in a dangerous<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
locality, and there’s danger all the time
of torpedoes, as well as floating mines, I reckon
they do keep their searchlights busy all the night
in order to discover any creeping enemy.”</p>

<p>“They know these Turks to be clever schemers,”
added Jack, “and bold in the bargain, so
they keep on the lookout all the time.”</p>

<p>“Then, if we’re discovered, what’s our program
going to be, Jack?”</p>

<p>“We want to get busy right away and run up
a white flag, to show that we mean to make no
resistance. Then they’ll likely send a boat, and
board as we lie to. We can surrender the cargo
to the officer in charge, first of all asking him to
make good our word to Captain Zenos and his
crew.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, to make doubly sure, we might let
them take to the small boat and skip out before
we surrender the vessel,” suggested Amos.</p>

<p>“Now that isn’t a bad scheme, if it can be
worked,” admitted Jack. “The Allies might
want to hold these men and I’d hate to have my
promise broken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>They sat there for a long time, now and then
exchanging a few sentences or going about to
make sure there was no danger of the hatch being
pried up, thus allowing the prisoners of the hold
to escape and make trouble.</p>

<p>Then what Jack had long been expecting came
about. A white shaft of light suddenly shot out
of the darkness and began to move along, swiftly
covering considerable space, and revealing the
choppy waves as though in broad daylight. It
was the powerful searchlight on board some war-vessel,
possibly a battleship of the Allied fleet.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_65" class="pagenum">[65]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE GLOW OF THE SEARCHLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack had their course changed a trifle so as
to bear direct for the source of that long ray of
brilliant light.</p>

<p>“See if you can find a sheet, or anything white,
that can be fastened up to show we do not mean
to offer resistance,” he told Amos, who soon had
the “flag of truce,” as he called it, in place.</p>

<p>“Seems to me, Jack, that if we mean to give
the captain his chance to get away we ought to
be doing it before that light gets us,” suggested
Amos, when he had once more joined his chum.</p>

<p>“It is a bit dangerous,” the other admitted,
“but if worked right, it might be done.”</p>

<p>“We could let them come up, one at a time, and
climb into the boat, after we made sure they carried
no weapons,” suggested Amos.</p>

<p>Jack weighed the chances. To be on the safe
side he knew they would be wise to let things go<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
as they were and trust to the officer on the boarding
boat to let them keep their word to the men.
Jack thought a good deal of his word, which,
once given, he would dislike to see broken.</p>

<p>“I guess Captain Zenos must be a well-known
character among the commanders of the Allied
vessels,” he mused. “As he’s probably run more
than a few cargoes of high explosives past their
lines they would like to wind up his career. You
see, he has caused a heap of damage by means of
the shells he’s smuggled across; and they would
want to shoot him. We’ll give him a chance,
Amos.”</p>

<p>On his part Amos was not unwilling. Ever
since he had seen the utterly fearless way in
which the smuggler and gun-runner had dashed
into that hold, not knowing but what the expected
explosion might come at any second, the
boy had conceived a certain amount of admiration
for him.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to be mighty careful, Jack,”
he warned the other. “These men are desperate,
and not to be trusted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll risk that, Amos. Now, attend to me,
and keep your pistol ready for use at a second’s
notice.”</p>

<p>He pounded on the hatch.</p>

<p>“Hello! down below!” Jack called out.</p>

<p>“What do you want now?” demanded a voice
which they recognized as belonging to the gun-runner
captain.</p>

<p>“We are close to the fleet, and, being afraid
that they might want to hold you and your men,
we would be willing to let you drop into the
small boat and row away, if you agreed to certain
conditions.”</p>

<p>The man on the other side of the closed hatch
seemed to ponder over the proposal. Evidently
he realized that the boys meant to do the right
thing, being a little afraid that after having
given their promise of immunity they could not
“deliver the goods.”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean,” he presently
called out. “What do you want us to promise
you, lad?”</p>

<p>“First that you will pass up every weapon you<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
have on your persons. Then, one by one, we will
let you come on deck, and get into the boat towing
astern. We will stop the engine so you may
have no trouble. When all are aboard the rope
will be cut, and you can lose yourselves in the
darkness. The sea is nearly calm so there need
be no trouble about getting ashore. What do
you say? You will have to hurry, for at any
minute now the searchlight will pick us up.”</p>

<p>“What you say sounds to me like you meant to
do the right thing,” called the captain. “Loosen
the hatch on one side, and we will hand over our
firearms. Then, as you say, we can crawl out,
one by one, and take our places in the small
boat.”</p>

<p>Jack believed that his plan was working out
finely. At the same time not for one moment
was he disposed to relax his vigilance. He even
managed to keep the man at the wheel under his
eye, as the fellow easily saw.</p>

<p>They loosened the fastenings of the hatch and
raised one side a few inches. A formidable six-shooter
was thrust through, of which Jack immediately<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
took possession. It was followed by two
others, showing that some of the sailor men had
made it a practice to go armed.</p>

<p>“That is all the firearms we have, I give you
my word,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Then let one of the men creep out, and tell
him he must get into the small boat without losing
a second of time. Also warn him, Captain,
that we will shoot at the first sign of treachery.”</p>

<p>Presently a man’s head appeared in view, and
then he commenced to crawl out of the narrow
opening. The boys kept him covered, and once
he gained the deck he was made to scuttle along,
clamber over the stern, and take his place in the
tender that had been towing behind all through
the voyage. It was amply large enough to hold
the five men without peril of being overcrowded.</p>

<p>No sooner had they disposed of this man than
a second was allowed to come up; after him came
the third sailor, with Captain Zenos himself
bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>The daring blockade-runner instantly saw the
flash of the searchlight and must have realized<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
that the American boys meant to treat him
fairly. The loss of his boat may have been a bitter
pill for him to swallow; but he was accustomed
to taking things as he found them.</p>

<p>“You have hit me a hard blow,” he told Jack.
“If ever I get a chance to turn the tables on you,
I will; but I want to say you are brave boys, and
I admire your pluck. I was always told American
boys beat the world that way. We may meet
again some of these days. Good-night!”</p>

<p>With that he, too, clambered over the side and
took his place in the small boat.</p>

<p>“Have you room for one more, Captain?”
asked Jack, and upon receiving an affirmative response
he turned to the man at the wheel, saying:
“Here, you, get aboard with the rest. We might
as well make a clean sweep while we’re about it.
I’ll take charge of the wheel when we start again.
I know enough about engines to run a tub like
this.”</p>

<p>The last of the blockade-runners did not wait
upon the order of his going. He seemed only
too well pleased to accompany his chief. The<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
prospect of being left behind to fall into the
hands of the enemy was not attractive to him.</p>

<p>As soon as this fellow had taken his seat in the
boat, Amos, who was hovering nearby, cast the
painter off, and immediately the small craft fell
astern, for the powerboat still had some headway.</p>

<p>“Bully for us!” exclaimed Amos. “We’re now
monarch of all we survey, Jack! And of all the
adventures that have come to us since striking
Europe this night is going to stand near the
head.”</p>

<p>“Don’t crow,” warned Jack. “The Indian
should never shout till he is in the woods, or the
white man till he is out of them. We’ve got some
troubles still ahead of us. I’m going to start up
the engine, and keep moving straight toward that
war vessel.”</p>

<p>“I think it must be a battleship, Jack, or a big
cruiser, from the size of the searchlight. Now
that I look around I can see a whole lot more of
the same kind of lights roving around further
on. Yes, we’ve struck the battle fleet at anchor<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
as sure as anything. If only Frank is somewhere
close by and safe, I’ll be satisfied.”</p>

<p>Jack had by this time succeeded in getting the
engine started. As he had said, he knew considerable
about running engines whether connected
with motorboats, automobiles or motorcycles,
having had a fair amount of experience
with them all.</p>

<p>They constantly decreased the distance separating
them from the source of that dazzling
light, which for the most part played in the other
direction.</p>

<p>Then all at once it began to circle in their
quarter.</p>

<p>“She’s going to hit us, I reckon, Jack!” called
out Amos, who stood forward and eagerly
watched every little thing that occurred.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the glare of the searchlight
came in his eyes, causing him to drop his head.
Apparently those aboard had strong glasses and
must have instantly discovered the Greek powerboat,
for the light remained stationary.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t turn one of those big sixteen-inch<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
guns loose on us,” ventured Amos, a
little uneasily.</p>

<p>“No danger of their wasting a shell on such
small game as this boat,” Jack assured him,
“when they have need of all they own to smash
the fortifications of Gallipoli and the Asiatic
mainland. I rather guess we’ll be seeing one of
those fleet destroyers dashing this way, to find
out who and what we are.”</p>

<p>“Well, our white rag shows up as plain as daylight,
and it ought to tell that we don’t mean
them any harm,” said Amos, relieved; though he
had to immediately laugh at the idea of that
miniature boat being a menace to a super-dreadnaught.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, as they continued to advance,
they discovered some object approaching
at furious speed. Then, as it came in range of
the searchlight, the boys saw that it was a torpedo-boat
destroyer painted a gray color that
could not be told from the surface of the sea at a
certain distance.</p>

<p>“We’d better pull up, hadn’t we, Jack?” asked<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Amos. “They’re whooping it up direct at us. I
hope they don’t mean to cut through this poor
boat like a knife would a cheese. Me for the
water if it looks that way, for there might be a
great old blow-up if there’s any dynamite below
deck here.”</p>

<p>Jack did shut off the power, although he had
no idea anything serious was impending in the
way his companion hinted.</p>

<p>Coming at the rate of thirty miles an hour it
did not take the destroyer long to arrive within
hailing distance of the Greek craft.</p>

<p>“I am sending a boat aboard to find out who
and what you are, and why you venture in this
forbidden zone!” roared a voice through a megaphone.</p>

<p>“Glad to know it, sir!” called Jack; and
possibly the fact that the words were spoken
in clear English must have surprised the
commander of the torpedo-boat not a little.</p>

<p>Immediately the boys discovered a small boat
dancing over the waves, propelled by a motor,<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
and occupied by a number of sailors as well as
an officer. It soon came alongside and one of
the men sprang aboard, after which the officer
followed suit.</p>

<p>He stared hard at the two lads as though
hardly able to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is the crew of this boat?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied the boy, with a smile.
“They originally consisted of seven Greeks and
a captain. His name was Captain Zenos, and
most likely you have heard about him. Three
of the crew we left on an island about fifteen
miles or so back there. The rest of them, with
their skipper, we allowed to go off in their small
boat, because we had given them our word of
honor they should not be made prisoners of war
if they promised not to blow up the boat when
we had them shut down in the hold.”</p>

<p>The man in uniform leaned forward and took
another searching look at Jack and Amos.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me, boy,” he demanded,
as though unable to believe his ears, “that you
two alone and unaided captured Captain Zenos,<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
who is known to be a dare-devil if ever one lived,
and his entire crew of seven men?”</p>

<p>“We are not boasting, sir, but that is the truth.
We knew the hold was filled with explosives, for
I examined it after taking passage aboard this
boat. So we fixed it that smoke issued forth,
and this so frightened some of the crew they
jumped overboard. But the captain was made of
better stuff, and with three of his men he went
below to put out the fire or die in the attempt.
That was when we clapped on the hatch, and
held them prisoners. It was all easy enough, and
things worked without a single hitch. And now
we want to hand this prize of the gun-runner
over to the Allies.”</p>

<p>The officer who had come from the torpedo-boat
destroyer held out his hand impulsively;
for he was British and could appreciate valor
wherever he found it.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ABOARD THE BATTLESHIP “THUNDERER.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“My word! I am delighted to have met such
a couple of smart lads, and I hope to hear the
particulars of your story aboard the <em>Thunderer</em>,
for you must come back with me to meet the
Vice-Admiral. You are English; that goes
without saying.”</p>

<p>Amos chuckled, while Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>“American, sir,” the latter said, briskly,
“though our ancestors came from your tight little
island, and also fought you for all they were
worth at Lexington and Bunker Hill.”</p>

<p>“I’m a bit sorry for that, my lad!” exclaimed
the lieutenant, “but, after all, we feel that in
this terrible crisis we can count on the sympathy
of all Americans who are not of German descent,
for we are fighting the battles of civilization and
true democracy. Pardon me for saying it, but
you know it looks somewhat strange to run<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
across a couple of American boys over here in
the war zone just now.”</p>

<p>That was a gentle hint for them to give some
sort of explanation, and this Jack was quite
ready to do.</p>

<p>“We realize that, sir, and can easily explain
why it happens. We are looking for the brother
of my chum and cousin here, whose father earnestly
desires to see him once more before he
passes away. There is a sad story back of it,
which it is not necessary for me to mention.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” asserted the officer, heartily;
“and I am sure the Vice-Admiral will not press
you on that score, for he is exceedingly kind.
You have reason to think the young man may be
somewhere in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“We have every reason to believe it, sir. When
we were in London Lord Kitchener, who is a
great friend of my chum’s father, Colonel Turner,
U. S. A., gave us a paper that has been of
considerable use to us. It helped us search
through that part of Belgium held by the Allied
armies, and also in Northern France. We<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
learned that Frank Turner was serving your
cause as an aviator, and after just missing him
with General French’s army we discovered that
he had been sent out here to assist in opening
the Dardanelles.”</p>

<p>“My word! but I admire your grit in following
after him through all the ruck; but then it is
just what might be expected of American boys.
I have a lady cousin in New York who never
tires of sounding the praises of your Boy Scouts,
and the wonderful things they do. And a line
from Kitchener of Khartoum would serve as an
‘Open Sesame’ even aboard a British battleship,
I imagine. But please make ready to accompany
me so you may meet the Vice-Admiral.”</p>

<p>“We will be only too glad to do so, sir,” replied
Jack. “Of course you expect to take charge
of this gun-runner, for the hold is filled with all
sorts of explosives?”</p>

<p>“A splendid haul!” declared the other. “Its
loss will be felt by the Turks, who are short on
ammunition. You deserve many thanks for
what you have done toward assisting the cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>“But we might not have considered it our
duty to capture the blockade-runner,” Jack
frankly told him, “only that we had good reason
to believe they were plotting to do us bodily
harm, or at least abandon us on some lonely
island where we might have heaps of trouble
getting away.”</p>

<p>“You may say that, my lad,” observed the lieutenant
pleasantly, “but nevertheless I am certain
that deep down in your hearts you are hand in
glove with our cause. In good time I expect
America will speak her mind, and the Kaiser will
discover that ‘hands across the sea’ stand for no
idle words. It will be the whole world <em>against
militarism</em>, and <em>not the German people, whom
we admire</em>.”</p>

<p>The boys did not expect to be aboard the smuggler
again, and therefore they took with them
what little luggage they carried. This was very
scanty, because, as Amos put it, they were “going
light,” and doing without a good many things
which, as ordinary travelers, they might have
deemed necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>In fact, they had long ago learned that it is
remarkable how few things are absolutely indispensable
when traveling, and especially with a
couple of rough-and-ready boys, accustomed to
looking after themselves.</p>

<p>Once in the small patrol tender of the destroyer
they speedily made the grim-looking little
fighter that could cover thirty miles an hour, and
then have a little reserve speed for an emergency.</p>

<p>Aboard this boat they were introduced to the
commander, who took something of the same
interest in them as the other officer had done.
It was so remarkable a thing to come upon two
American boys under circumstances like these
that he felt a great and pardonable curiosity to
hear something of their story.</p>

<p>Amos, who had by that time recovered his
tongue, in particular, was not averse to obliging
him, and rattled off an account of some of the
adventures that had befallen them since crossing
over from London and searching along the battle
lines in Belgium for the missing Frank.</p>

<p>When the commander learned that this brother<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
was no other than Frank Bradford, whose exploits
had passed from hand to mouth wherever
the Allies fought, he was doubly charmed. At
the same time he expressed the pious wish that
the boys might fail in their mission, because the
cause needed aviators like the daring bird-man,
and his loss would mean a big gap in the
ranks.</p>

<p>The questions asked by the commander were
principally about how they came to embark on
the powerboat in some Grecian sea town, and
what caused them to decide to try and effect the
capture of the lawless craft. These events would
make a brave showing in his report of the night’s
work; for Captain Zenos had long been a thorn
in the flesh of the Allies, carrying many a cargo
of arms and explosives past their lines into
Turkish camps.</p>

<p>“I am only sorry he slipped through our fingers
this time,” he told the boys as they drew
near the bulky battleship, from which the searchlight
shone upon them, and the small craft followed
in their rear, manned by a prize crew;<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
“but with his vessel gone he may have his services
crippled somewhat. And besides, he may be
picked up by one of our scout boats.”</p>

<p>A short time later Jack and Amos found themselves
aboard the battleship. It certainly gave
them a thrill to realize that they actually trod the
deck of one of His Majesty’s big bulldogs of the
navy, a vessel that doubtless daily engaged some
of the Turkish batteries along the shores of the
Gallipoli Peninsula or on the Anatolian mainland.</p>

<p>They were speedily taken into the presence of
the Vice-Admiral. He may have been a gruff
sea-dog in the eyes of his men, and known as a
martinet; but he had another and much more
genial side to his nature, which he exhibited to
his two young American guests.</p>

<p>Perhaps the magical paper which they made
haste to show him, signed by Kitchener himself,
may have had something to do with his amiable
manner, for it was simply wonderful how often
that document had helped them over rough places.
He insisted on the boys making themselves comfortable<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
in his cabin, and begged to hear their
whole story, for already he confessed to being
deeply interested in two such manly-looking cousins
from across the sea.</p>

<p>When mention was made of Frank, and how
they had discovered that he was doing remarkable
work in the cause of the Allies under the
name of Bradford, the Vice-Admiral showed
great interest. He had heard more or less about
the famous flier who bore that name, although
thus far ignorant of the fact that he had joined
the aviation corps on duty with the Dardanelles
battle fleet.</p>

<p>“You shall stay aboard our ship temporarily,
lads,” he told them later on, “and I promise you
to do my best to locate the party you seek, if
he is indeed out on this station. It is hardly
within the rules to have non-combatants aboard
during war times, but that wonderful paper you
carry would be ample excuse for any infraction,
since it calls upon every one in authority to aid
you to the best of their ability.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Admiral, and we can only<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
thank you, and say we will accept,” Jack assured
him, heartily.</p>

<p>“And it won’t be the first time we’ve bunked in
a hammock, either, sir,” declared Amos, gleefully,
for he began to see the troubles ahead of
them vanishing, as had so often been the case in
the past.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be a little disappointed,
then,” the officer told him; “I could not put you
with the crew, for many reasons. It happens,
however, that one of our officers was invalided
home, and his place has not yet been filled, so
you must occupy his quarters for the time being.”</p>

<p>After that he asked many more questions, and
seemed greatly interested in his two young
American guests. Doubtless there would be
ways to explain just how they chanced to
be aboard the <em>Thunderer</em>, despite all rules and
regulations, for a Vice-Admiral is at times a law
unto himself.</p>

<p>Finally Jack and Amos were given into the
charge of one of the several officers who had
been in the cabin during the recital of their story,<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
and all of whom evinced a lively interest in the
boys.</p>

<p>“This is something we never dreamed would
happen, Jack,” remarked Amos, when the two
found themselves left in the comfortable if snug
quarters assigned to them. “Think of us aboard
a regular battleship that has been in action, and
may be again tomorrow, for all we know.”</p>

<p>“We are certainly in great luck,” admitted
Jack, yawning sleepily. “Between you and the
lamp-post I like that Vice-Admiral a whole lot.
He may have gained a name as a fighter and
all that, but deep down in his heart he is a fine
specimen of a sailor. And to think that he has
several sons of his own, all of them serving their
country either in the army or the navy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only hope our luck holds good, so that
we may see how they bombard the old Turkish
forts,” wished Amos. “We’ve been on the firing
line in Belgium, had a chance to visit the
French war trenches, and see some action there;
and if only we could watch the battle fleet at
work, I’d be satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Leave that for another day,” advised Jack,
preparing for bed.</p>

<p>Despite all that had come to them of late in the
way of excitement, as well as the peculiar conditions
by which they were even then surrounded,
both boys managed to drop asleep soon after their
heads struck the pillows. If the waves arose in
the night, and the heavy battleship wallowed
somewhat as she progressed slowly this way and
that, so as to keep on the move, they knew nothing
of it, for they had proved their right of being
called good sailors.</p>

<p>When they did awaken they found that the day
had come. Yes, and the vessel was in motion,
going at a fair rate of speed. Amos was thrilled
with the thought that there might be something
in the wind.</p>

<p>As he hastily dressed, his talk was all in the
line of action. He certainly hoped there was
work cut out for the <em>Thunderer</em> that same day.</p>

<p>“I’m just crazy to hear those big twelve-inch
guns boom,” he told his companion, “though I
guess it’ll nearly deafen us at first. We must<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
find out what the men do to soften the sound.
I’ve heard that standing on your toes helps a
whole lot; and then holding your hands over your
ears is a good thing.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some cotton that we can use to stop
our ears up if it’s necessary, so don’t bother your
head about that part of it,” Jack told him.</p>

<p>Having hastily finished their dressing, the two
boys made their way to the deck. They excited
considerable interest among such of the crew as
they met, and unaware of what rank the two
young chaps might hold many of these saluted
them as though they were officers.</p>

<p>Looking ahead in the early morning the boys
could see the distant jaws of land that doubtless
marked the entrance to the Dardanelles Straits;
numerous other big and little war vessels dotted
the surface of the heaving sea.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_89" class="pagenum">[89]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BOMBARDING THE TURKISH FORTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Jack, I do believe they are going in today to
engage the Turkish forts!” exclaimed Amos, after
taking a good look around at the stirring picture.</p>

<p>The sun, not far above the horizon, shone upon
the glistening sea, and in almost every quarter
the boys could see war vessels moving steadily
in the direction of the land ahead. There were
battleships, super-dreadnaughts, cruisers, torpedo-boat
destroyers and dispatch boats, all
stripped for action and looking in grim earnest
as they moved along in seemingly endless procession.</p>

<p>“I’m a little inclined to say the same thing myself,”
Jack announced. “But no matter whether
it happens or not we are in great luck to be able
to set eyes on a glorious picture like this.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget it if I live to the age of Methuselah!”<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
affirmed Amos. “Just see how the
mosquito craft dodge around, and serve to protect
the big ships from any sort of torpedo attack.
They must be on the watch all the time,
because even a giant super-dreadnaught would
go down like a stone if struck from a submarine.”</p>

<p>“I hope the <em>Thunderer</em> isn’t doomed to wind
up that way, then,” remarked Jack. “With something
like a thousand men aboard, we would have
a mighty small chance to swim clear of the wreck,
and might be sucked down when she sank. But
they’re not depending so much on torpedoes out
here as floating mines.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the lieutenant told us when on
the destroyer,” said Amos. “It seems that there
is always a swift current or tide flowing on the
surface from out of the straits. By setting floating
mines free above the Narrows, the German
engineers, who are helping their allies, the Turks,
in this campaign, can send them down upon the
battle fleet as it works in the straits.”</p>

<p>“Those are what they call contact mines, I
reckon, Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, they have triggers projecting from them,
and contact with the side of a warship causes
the explosion. They’ve already caused a whole
lot of trouble, and several big war vessels have
gone down in the straits through their work.”</p>

<p>“Then, besides, there have been heaps of regular
mines, to be fired by electricity,” Amos went
on to say. “The Allies have small boats called
mine sweepers that use a sort of net, and drag
for these mines. They’ve cleared most of them
out of the first five miles of the straits, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Speaking about submarines,” Jack remarked,
“the Germans don’t happen to be the only ones
that have them. The lieutenant told us about a
British submersible that dived under all the rows
of mines in the Narrows, and reached the Sea of
Marmora, where for several days it kicked up a
great row, sinking several Turkish transports,
one or two warships, and even bombarding the
docks at Constantinople, trying to destroy, they
say, the bridge across which so much of their
supplies come to the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“If that account is all true,” declared Amos,
“that was a feat of daring unequalled in this
whole war, according to my way of thinking.
The commander of that undersea boat will get
the Victoria Cross, you can bet.”</p>

<p>The boys were about this time informed they
could have breakfast, since everything was being
hurried on that morning because there was stern
business ahead.</p>

<p>They met several of the officers in the mess-room,
who greeted them in the most friendly
way. They had heard enough of the boys’ story
to understand that the two young Americans
were a brave lot, and had actually alone and single-handed
captured the notorious gun-runner,
Captain Zenos, together with his entire crew of
seven men.</p>

<p>The boat had been sent somewhere to be relieved
of her dangerous cargo, which in turn
would be utilized against the Turks. Later on
that same powerboat was likely to become a mine-sweeper,
for which service the craft was admirably
fitted. So that, after all, Jack and Amos had<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
been instrumental in adding to the Allied fleet
by one useful unit.</p>

<p>By the time breakfast had been dispatched
the sound of heavy firing brought the two boys
out on deck in a hurry, eager to witness whatever
went on.</p>

<p>“They’re engaging the forts at long range,”
said Amos, immediately, as he saw a volume of
smoke shoot out from a battleship a mile away,
and almost immediately heard the awful crash
of the big gun.</p>

<p>“Yes, miles away,” Jack observed. “They
have the range figured down to a dot. If they
waste a shot they soon know it.”</p>

<p>“But how can they, when even with a glass
no one could see the Turkish forts away up
in the straits?” Amos asked, filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>“If you look up in the heavens you’ll have
your answer,” Jack told him.</p>

<p>“Oh! now I see what you mean; there are eyes
in the sky. Those aeroplanes are a part of the
Allies’ outfit, and they keep watching all the time<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
to see where the shells fall, so as to correct the
fire. It’s a great scheme, isn’t it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“A part of the war game of today, Amos, for
we’re living in a fast age. Before this war is
over I firmly believe there will be battleships of
the air as well as of the sea, and they won’t be
Zeppelins either.”</p>

<p>“Just to think,” the other boy mused, “right
now I may be looking up at my brother Frank,
for there’s a pretty big chance if he’s still alive
one of those dots in the sky is his aeroplane.
And, Jack, if we notice anyone of them that
seems to be more daring than the rest, that’ll be
Frank, by all accounts.”</p>

<p>Steadily the <em>Thunderer</em> pressed on, still heading
for the jaws of land that marked the end of
the Dardanelles Straits. With the passage of
every minute the eagerness of the two lads increased
until Amos was almost quivering with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Look, Jack, I do believe they’re getting ready
to fire one of the big guns in that forward turret.
If you’ve got that cotton handy, please give me<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
a wad, for I don’t want to have my ear-drums
cracked by the sound.”</p>

<p>What he said turned out to be the truth, for
the gunners aboard the battleship had been given
orders to start the ball rolling, as they were now
well within the zone for firing, according to the
map.</p>

<p>When the terrific roar broke out the boys could
feel themselves flattened up along the object they
chanced to be leaning against at the time. It
seemed as though they had received a strong
slap with an unseen plank, though it did not hurt
them any.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that shell smashed a gun over in
the Turkish battery?” said Amos, as he sniffed
at the powder smoke that filled the air for a
brief time.</p>

<p>The <em>Thunderer</em> did not repeat her first shot.
It may have been a signal to tell the enemy
she was coming straight on. There was other
work cut out for the big vessels of the fleet for
that particular morning.</p>

<p>As they continued to approach the entrance to<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
the straits, Amos became excited again. He had
seen other warships pass through, firing as they
ran, and there was evidently a warm reply from
certain enemy batteries and forts, for explosions
could be seen in the air, as well as upheavals
in the water, looking like the geysers in
Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>“This beats anything I’ve ever run across!”
exclaimed Amos, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a great sight, and one we never
expected to see,” added Jack, though both of
them were compelled to speak much above their
ordinary tones on account of all the thunderous
noise that came over the water.</p>

<p>Some of the vessels were already within the
straits, and engaging the enemy to the right and
left. Smoke shrouded them from view, and
through this pall the flash of the big guns could
be seen now and then. Such a din the boys had
never listened to. It was like ten thunder storms
rolled into one, and “then some,” as Amos declared.</p>

<p>“Talk to me about the Lower Regions!” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
“but this is a pretty fair imitation of
what I’ve always believed they looked like. Oh!
did you see that hit when a shell exploded aboard
that cruiser? It must have done heaps of damage,
and killed or injured many of the crew. But
you don’t notice any slackening of her fire, do
you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“If the boat received serious damage she will
pull out pretty soon, and allow a substitute to
take her place,” Jack explained. “I understand
there’s no haphazard work about all this, but
every warship has a line of attack laid out that
must be pursued.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Amos admitted, “I can see that while
one tackles the batteries over on the Asiatic side
of the straits, another sets boldly in and shells
a fort on Gallipoli. It will be our turn pretty
soon now, for we are entering the jaws of land.
Seddul Bahr lies over on the left, and down on
the other jaw is Kum Kaleh, both of them long
since smashed to pieces, we heard.”</p>

<p>“If the straits were all five miles wide the battle
fleet would have passed on through before<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
now,” Jack asserted. “It’s because of the Narrows,
and the swift current that carries all the
floating mines with it that has held them up.
And in my opinion it will be a long time before
they break through to Constantinople, for the
Turks are fierce fighters, and Mohammedans at
that.”</p>

<p>“Why do you add that remark; how does the
fact of their being followers of Mahomet make
any difference, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Only this,” explained Jack, “as a part of his
religion a Mohammedan believes that it is a great
honor to be killed in battle, and anyone dying in
that way will be transported direct to Paradise.
This makes them utterly fearless, and has accounted
for most of their victories.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! But it’s almost time for us to get
busy, seems like, Jack. There, you can see the
big gun is moving with the turret, so as to get
in line with some strong Turkish fort far up the
waterway, perhaps Kilid Bahr itself in the Narrows.”</p>

<p>Amos made sure to obtain a good grip on<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
something as he stood on his tip-toes, and opened
his mouth in the bargain, after the most approved
method of lessening the coming shock. His ears
were stuffed with cotton, and it had been necessary
for Jack to fairly shout in order to be heard
by his companion.</p>

<p>Then came the terrific crash. They knew that
strong glasses were instantly brought into use
to learn what sort of success the gunners had
obtained. Doubtless those especially deputized
for the work watched a certain aeroplane to learn
from the signals whether the shell had fallen in
the enemy fort, or dropped short. Getting the
range in this fashion while at a distance of several
miles from the unseen target was the modern
method of sea fighting.</p>

<p>Those in the artfully concealed forts and batteries
could easily see their floating targets, and
rain shells upon them. That the vessels were not
hit more frequently was caused by their being
constantly in motion, for there were expert German
gunners behind those shore guns doing most
of the work. Had it been left entirely to the<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
Turks the battle fleet would have made short
work with the defenses of the famous Dardanelles.</p>

<p>Again and again did the <em>Thunderer</em> take her
turn to hurl a monster shell at the Turkish forts.
It was plainly the object of this morning assault
to do as much damage as possible, while the
sweepers kept busily at work catching such of
the dangerous mines as came within their reach.</p>

<p>Much of the lower five miles of the waterway
had already been well cleared of these perils, so
that the big battleships could move along without
incurring extraordinary danger of being blown
up.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this confusion and racket
there suddenly came a crash of a distinctly different
nature, and both boys felt the concussion of
air. As they instinctively shrank back appalled,
they realized that a shell had actually struck and
exploded aboard the battleship!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_101" class="pagenum">[101]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE IN THE STRAITS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a dreadful silence aboard the battleship
following the explosion of that Turkish
shell. Both the boys had been knocked down by
the concussion. They sat up, looking rather stupid,
and Amos was rubbing the back of his head
as though it had come in for a smart blow when
it struck the metal deck.</p>

<p>Jack looked him over anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not hurt, I hope, Amos?” he exclaimed, when
he could find his breath.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;I guess only a bump or so,” stammered
the other, trying to smile, although the effort was
a dismal failure because it made his head hurt.
“Say, that was a peach of a crack, wasn’t it?
They got our range that time all right, seems like,
and more may follow that shell.”</p>

<p>“They’ve changed the course of the ship, I
think,” said Jack, “for the purpose of blocking<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
that very game. I wonder how much damage it
did aboard?”</p>

<p>“I’m almost afraid to find out,” Amos admitted,
“because some of the poor fellows may be
lying around terribly hurt, or else blown into
bits.”</p>

<p>Gaining their feet they pushed in the direction
of the spot where the shell had burst. It was
forward on the port side, and from this fact they
knew the missile must have come from a battery
or fort on Gallipoli and not the Asiatic side of
the straits.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that there was nothing but the
best of steel to be struck by the monster shell, so
powerful was the explosive contained in the same
that much material damage had been effected.
Luckily few of the crew chanced to be within
reach of the explosion. Three men received minor
wounds, no one was killed, and the damage,
the boys quickly learned, was not likely to interfere
in the least with the work laid out for the
<em>Thunderer</em> on that morning.</p>

<p>“If one of those big things ever burst close to<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
a fellow,” Amos commented as he examined the
effect of the gunfire, “it would be all day with
him.”</p>

<p>“One thing sure,” Jack added, “he would never
know what hurt him. It would be like being
struck by lightning; they say the victim sees a
flash, and that is the end of it. He never lives
long enough to hear the thunder, even when it
comes hot on the heels of the lightning.”</p>

<p>The boys were greatly interested in the humble
and dangerous though necessary work of the
numerous mine-sweepers. Glory there was none
for the brave-hearted men aboard the small boats
that kept stubbornly at their labor, despite the
fire to which they were frequently subjected.
Now and then one might be hit and go down,
whereupon the crew of a few men must take their
chances with the sharks known to infest those
waters when there was so much fighting going
on.</p>

<p>“They are heroes, every one of them,” Amos
declared, when they talked of the remarkable
courage shown by the men aboard these small<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
craft. “Just as much as the fellow who does
some striking deed in the spotlight, and is rewarded
by the Nation’s praise, as well as the
Victoria Cross. But <em>they</em> never expect to be
known, and are content to just go on and do
their work the best way they can see, content if
success crowns their efforts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and right now, Amos, while we’re talking
about the risks they run, if you look at that
sweeper over near the shore you’ll see she’s sinking.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Jack; she must have been struck
by a shot of some kind from one of those concealed
shore batteries. These Turks are pretty
clever about hiding their guns, and suddenly
making a killing. The meanest patch of brush
may shelter three or four guns that even the aviators
above fail to see.”</p>

<p>“I think the commanders on the warships dread
those hidden batteries more than they do the big
guns at Kilid Bahr or Chanak up in the Narrows,”
Jack went on to say.</p>

<p>“Then they ought to do something to find out<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
where they are located, I should think,” was the
opinion expressed by his comrade.</p>

<p>“The mine-sweepers are helping to do that,
for it seems the gunners lying hidden among the
gullies ashore find it hard to resist smashing one
when they get an opportunity. And that, you
know, Amos, shows the watchers on the warships
just where to send some of their big shells.”</p>

<p>All this while the busy birdmen were circling
the battle field, and constantly seeking to impart
important information which, from their lofty
eyrie, they were enabled to collect.</p>

<p>“They can see a thousand things from up
there, you know,” Jack was saying presently
when they watched one of the airmen dropping
little bombs that made a great smoke, but which
were intended simply as signals to the fleet.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they could
watch the movements of a submarine far below
the surface of the water. I really wonder why
aeroplanes haven’t been used to follow and destroy
some of the German submersibles that have
commenced preying on British commerce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps they have, for all we can say,” Jack
told him. “I know from experiments that when
you’re fifty feet above a shallow body of water
you can, in calm weather, see the bottom everywhere.
That’s how the fish-hawk picks out the
prize it wants for its dinner.”</p>

<p>Their exchange of remarks had to be frequently
interrupted, for there were violent bursts
of cannonading that rendered conversation next
to impossible. Many of the British and French
warships were now inside the strait, and doing
their utmost to silence the enemy batteries.</p>

<p>This was not all by any means. From other
positions many miles away came the heaviest of
booming. The boys understood that this marked
the presence of the super-dreadnaught <em>Queen
Elizabeth</em>, which from a station out in the open
sea could drop enormous shells from her sixteen-inch
guns on the Turkish forts in the Narrows,
doing great damage.</p>

<p>After the time when Jack and his cousin
had the privilege of witnessing that battle in
the straits the conditions changed radically.<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
Thanks to those same floating mines that sank a
number of vessels, the frontal attack had to be
given up, and a new campaign inaugurated,
troops by the tens of thousands being landed on
Gallipoli, to try and push the stubborn Turks
from their lines.</p>

<p>As they stood there on the deck of the <em>Thunderer</em>
and watched the stirring drama of sea and
land forces in conflict, <a id="Ref_107"></a>the two American boys
realized that they were in touch with one of the
grandest combats the world had ever known.
History would so record it, they felt sure, as they
gazed with rapt attention, taking in all the marvelous
sights.</p>

<p>Another shell burst against the side of the battleship,
and must have made more or less of a
dent in her armor. This was to be expected; indeed
few of those many staunch warships would
pass through this combat without signs to show
for their perilous adventure. But if they survived
the fighting, those dents would always be
looked upon as marks of approval; just as a veteran’s
wounds give him cause for personal pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>Several more of the crew had been injured
by shrapnel bursting overhead; for the enemy
tried by every means in his power to damage the
vessels, and those who manned them.</p>

<p>An officer, seeing that the boys were standing
in a very exposed position, came, and with the
compliments of the Vice-Admiral invited them to
change to a place where they would at least be
safe from this overhead peril. They were not
slow to accept, for neither of them cared to be
reckless while so many missiles of death were
flying through the air.</p>

<p>They had one opportunity to witness the result
of the gunfire aboard the battleship. A shell
burst amidst a copse ashore two miles away, and
they distinctly saw men being hurled into the air,
as well as parts of a dismantled cannon. A
hearty cheer from the whole crew told what they
thought of that shot.</p>

<p>“Look at that destroyer shooting along, Jack!”
suddenly called out Amos, pointing as he spoke
to a slender vessel of great speed that was flying
with the grace of a swallow past the battleship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>“There’s something up, as sure as you live!”
suggested Jack, immediately deeply interested.</p>

<p>“She seems to be heading right up the straits,
and acts as if they meant to try and run through
the Narrows yonder,” Amos suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, hardly that!” Jack told him. “There
wouldn’t be one chance in ten she could run the
batteries on the shore in that narrow part of the
straits. They’d sink her with their smaller guns;
but even if she did get through, of what use
would she be in the Sea of Marmora, with the
Turkish fleet to reckon with?”</p>

<p>“But see how she still keeps flying on, Jack, as
if she had wings. I never saw such speed before
with any kind of boat. What can be the
object of it all, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I expect it’s what I spoke about a while ago,
Amos. She has been sent out to serve as a floating
target for the concealed batteries of the
Turks.”</p>

<p>“What colossal nerve!” cried Amos, almost
holding his breath as he watched the swift progress
of the destroyer. “She offers herself as a<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
target for all the guns they can bring to bear on
her. The chances are three to one they’ll never
come back again after making the circuit.”</p>

<p>“Those aboard have their orders, and they’ll
carry them out despite all the Turkish guns
within ten miles. They may go down, but if, by
sacrificing themselves, they show up one or two
hidden batteries that can be destroyed by the battleships,
they will have died gloriously, like thousands
of others of their kind have done since the
days of the Spanish armada.”</p>

<p>Thrilled by the spectacle of valor exhibited by
the crew of the little destroyer, the two lads stood
and kept their eyes riveted on the flitting boat.
They could not remember the time when they
had felt such a deep interest in anything. When
presently the first shell exploded near the destroyer
Amos gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a close shave, let me tell you,
Jack!” he exclaimed. “I wonder if the brave
commander or any of his crew could have been
killed, or seriously wounded by that shell. And,
Jack, doesn’t the destroyer look sort of familiar<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
to you? I honestly believe it’s the very same boat
we were on last night.”</p>

<p>“That would be hard to say,” his chum explained,
“because most of them are built along
similar models, and it would be easy to mistake
one for another. You can see a dozen of the
scout-boats right now inside the straits. But
that particular one has for some reason been
picked for this daring game of drawing the fangs
of the enemy, by tempting the gunners in their
hidden batteries to take a chance.”</p>

<p>“Whoever the commander is I take off my hat
to him,” asserted Amos, suiting the action to the
word.</p>

<p>“Oh! it strikes me that bravery is becoming
mighty common these days, Amos. Already
there have been dozens of astonishing feats carried
out on both sides that make those stories in
history look pretty poor.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Amos, “tell me what is
there in Leonidas and his three hundred deathless
Spartans holding the pass of Thermopylæ
beside some of the things that are happening all<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
around us every day, what with these fearless
aviators, the men who go down under the ocean
in submarines, and those who laugh at death, like
the crew of that destroyer are doing this very
minute?”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping they get through all right, after
all,” Jack wished. “You can see that by now
they’ve reached the last Allied warship. Still
they keep right on, changing their course constantly
so that the white bubbles in their wake
look like a snake. There, did you hear that shot
from the shore? I can see the smoke, but there
isn’t a sign of a cannon in sight. I reckon that
was a time when the destroyer got a bite.”</p>

<p>Hardly had his last word been spoken than
there was a mighty crash. The <em>Thunderer</em> had
sent her compliments at the Turkish shore battery
so cleverly hidden, and the location of which
had been revealed by that one incautious shot.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_113" class="pagenum">[113]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AMIDST THE CRASH OF BIG GUNS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As if that one tremendous crash had been a
prearranged signal, several others among the
scattered war vessels fired a shot toward the
shore where that burst of smoke had betrayed
the concealed Turkish battery.</p>

<p>Somehow, as Jack afterwards said, it reminded
him forcibly of a pack of dogs hanging
around and watching one of their number skirmish
for a bone; no sooner had he pawed up the
ground and made an important discovery than
the entire pack scrambled for its possession.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the smoke cloud drifted in front
of the two boys so as to shut out their view, for
which they were sorry. But there could not be
the least doubt that the terrible volley must have
utterly annihilated the members of the luckless
battery, as well as smashed their guns.</p>

<p>At least no further shot came from that particular<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
quarter as long as the little destroyer
remained within range.</p>

<p>“They got what they invited, I guess,” Amos
exclaimed, looking relieved when no further
shots came from the brush in front of the gully
where the battery had been lying hidden for
days perhaps, awaiting a chance to do something.</p>

<p>Jack had his binoculars leveled at the spot.</p>

<p>“I can’t see the least movement there,” he declared.
“All the ground is torn up in a frightful
way, and I think I can pick out the end of a
gun that is covered with rocks. Yes, and there
is another lying part-way in the water, too.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other almost in awe
at the frightful result of that volley from the
fleet. Then Jack handed the glasses over so that
his chum could see for himself the gruesome
sight.</p>

<p>The destroyer had not stopped because of this
one incident. Encouraged by their initial success
in disclosing the hiding-place of the enemy,
the daring crew meant to keep right along, venturing<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
several miles up the straits, and trying
to invite another battery to take a chance.</p>

<p>Shells were exploding all around the boat,
for distant gunners took up the challenge, and
endeavored to hit the fleet craft. Her speed was
all that saved her on several occasions, for the
boys could see the water churned up in her rear
as flying missiles struck too late, through a miscalculation
as to her swiftness.</p>

<p>For the time being pretty much all the firing
had ceased on the part of the invading war vessels.
It seemed as though everyone were interested
in the fate of the venturesome destroyer.
Doubtless, had another battery fired from the
shore it must have been instantly overwhelmed
in the hail of explosives that would speed that
way, since every Allied gunner seemed wild to
have a share in the fun.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to hit her with any kind of
success,” called out Amos, for the enemy guns
were still booming from the forts further up
the straits toward the Narrows; and here and
there came a distant report from the Anatolian<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
shore far back from the edge of the water.</p>

<p>“No, it looks as if she bore a charmed life,”
admitted Jack, as he saw another geyser spout up
far behind the mocking boat that kept tempting
the Turkish and German gunners.</p>

<p>“Still, it would take only one hit to finish her,”
Amos went on to say, with renewed apprehension.
Somehow he seemed to take a personal interest
in the fortunes of those gallant men who
were showing the kind of <a id="Ref_116"></a>mettle they were made
of, in thus risking death in order to push their
cause forward.</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken than they saw a shell
burst apparently directly alongside the destroyer,
which was wreathed in smoke, as though her own
guns had also been fired shoreward at the same
instant.</p>

<p>Jack clapped the glasses to his eyes while Amos
stood there holding his breath, for he feared that
the worst must have happened, and the little destroyer
met the fate she had tempted.</p>

<p>Then both boys gave a shout, and from a thousand
throats the same sound welled forth until<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
it rang over the agitated waters of the Dardanelles;
for the saucy little destroyer had suddenly
appeared, emerging from the smoke cloud,
and speeding merrily onward as though scorning
the efforts of the enemy to bring about her
destruction.</p>

<p>And though the boat continued further along
for several miles, all the while fired on from the
distant forts, she seemed to be able to defy all
their best efforts, for when finally the signal was
given for her to return she had escaped the rain
of shot and shell.</p>

<p>And it might be noticed that the lesson of that
smashed battery had not been lost upon the observing
enemy, for although there may have been
others hidden amidst the gullies and rocks along
the shore they fired no shot to betray their whereabouts.
After that one lesson they “tumbled to
the game,” as Amos afterwards said, and lay
low.</p>

<p>When it was seen that the mission of the destroyer
had come to an end temporarily the bombardment
of the forts was resumed with greater<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
violence than before. Once again the great guns
boomed, and the smoke drifted with the wind
across the straits. It proved to be one of
the most furious attacks thus far attempted,
and doubtless considerable damage was done,
not only to the forts themselves, but in destroying
the guns with which they were
mounted.</p>

<p>During all this time the mine sweepers had
been getting in their work. They accomplished
it in a modest manner, and there was no halo of
romance about what they were doing so that
they never received the salvo of cheers that
greeted the successful return of the destroyer.
At the same time they took desperate chances,
since nearly all of the time they were under fire,
from both big guns and smaller pieces.</p>

<p>More than one of the sweepers were struck and
sunk. Those of the crew able to do so immediately
attempted to swim to one of the other
small vessels, to be taken aboard. Not all of
them were so fortunate, and when the roll-call
came later many were not present to answer,<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
having either fallen into the hands of the enemy,
or else sunk to a watery grave.</p>

<p>From the distance over which these small boats
made their way it was evident that they had succeeded
in clearing some miles of the straits of the
fixed mines, which was one of the objects of the
day’s work.</p>

<p>At that time in the earlier period of the fight
for the Dardanelles it was positively believed by
the Allies that weight of metal would assuredly
carry the battleships through the straits, and
the sea wall of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Although several casualties had already been
recorded from those dangerous floating mines
that were set adrift in shoals above the Narrows,
the commanders of the fleet were unable to
bring themselves to believe anything could prevent
them from accomplishing their purpose as
first laid out.</p>

<p>We know that later on a radical change was
made in the program. The passage of the Dardanelles,
promised for the first of May, had not
been accomplished by the first of September,<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
when there was trench warfare ashore, with tens
of thousands killed and wounded on both sides,
and the end still unknown.</p>

<p>At the time Jack and Amos found themselves
with the battle fleet a spirit of optimism pervaded
the various units composing the immense flotilla.
Possibly the knowledge that they had already
shattered a number of the forts at the lower end
of the passageway had much to do with this confidence.
They could not yet seem to grasp the
fact that the swift current that set through the
Narrows, coming from the Sea of Marmora day
and night, was fated to be their eventual undoing,
and render all their efforts vain, for it bore
countless floating mines capable of sinking even
a super-dreadnaught upon contact.</p>

<p>The boys had become heartily tired of it all by
this time. Their heads rang from the dreadful
concussion, and Amos even declared he had a
splitting headache.</p>

<p>“I shall go crazy if they don’t drop out soon,
stop these terrible broadsides of living, fiery
metal, and get away!” he told his cousin, who was<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
just then observing some of the aeroplanes that
still sailed back and forth in the clear skies above.</p>

<p>“Watch that fellow away over yonder,” he told
Amos, clapping the binoculars in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh! do you think he can be Frank?” cried the
other, trembling as he started to adjust the
glasses to his sight.</p>

<p>“That’s more than I’d like to say,” replied
Jack, “though it might be possible, for right now
he’s taking desperate chances to carry out a little
scheme he’s set up, hoping to do some damage
to the Turks, in all this excitement, where the
shells of the fleet can’t reach them.”</p>

<p>“He is swooping low, as sure as anything,” admitted
Amos, eagerly. “It seems to me he must
be throwing something down at a fort below him.
There, I could see a little cloud of gray smoke
burst close by the aeroplane, so they must be
sending shrapnel up at him from those anti-airship
guns.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he is doing, Amos, throwing
bombs down at a magazine he has discovered.
Turn the glasses lower, and watch to see if there<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
is any sort of an explosion on the ground. That
would give it away if he succeeds.”</p>

<p>Ten seconds later and Amos uttered a shout.</p>

<p>“He did it, Jack, sure he did! You can see
the cloud of dense smoke that is rising right now!
He must have exploded a magazine, and created
no end of trouble for the Turks. Bully for the
man in the aeroplane, whether he’s my brother
Frank or another of his stripe!”</p>

<p>Jack saw good reason to believe that what his
comrade cried out was true. There had suddenly
arisen a great cloud of smoke many times
larger than would have followed the discharge
of a single gun. They could not hear the thunder
that may have accompanied the rending of
the magazine walls, on account of the heavy cannonading
that was going on intermittently
around them.</p>

<p>As though satisfied, after having accomplished
the errand with which he had been entrusted, the
bold airman now commenced to bore upward in
spirals, meaning to baffle all the attempts of the
Turkish gunners to strike his machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“See, they are trying their level best to fetch
him down, just in a spirit of revenge, I reckon!”
cried Amos, as he kept the glasses glued to his
eyes; for somehow he seemed to feel that he was
looking at his long-missing brother Frank, because
this venturesome feat tallied exactly with
others which the American aviator had successfully
carried through in the past.</p>

<p>A few minutes later and he seemed satisfied
the aviator had risen beyond range of the shrapnel,
for he handed the binoculars back to Jack.
His face was beaming with happiness and pride,
for Amos certainly felt that a new honor had
come to the Turner family.</p>

<p>“This time I really believe the <em>Thunderer</em> is
going to get out of the straits for good!” Jack
observed. Although the battleship had swung
around the circle a number of times, so as to
always keep moving, and present a difficult target
to the enemy, up to then they had invariably
come back again for a few more shots at distant
Kilid Bahr and Chanak forts, the one on the left
and the other on the right of the Narrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>Amos was delighted to hear it. His head rang
with the terrible noise, despite his precautions
with regard to stuffing his ears with cotton.
Never in all his life had he heard one-tenth the
racket that for two hours or more had assailed
him even in the most terrible thunder storm of
his experience.</p>

<p>Yes, the warships were actually leaving the
straits, satisfied with the execution they had
done. Thousands of tons of metal had been
hurled upon the batteries and forts of the enemy,
and great destruction must have followed. Still,
this severe business could not be kept up indefinitely;
it was too fierce a strain on both men and
guns.</p>

<p>So by degrees the firing died down. A few
vessels lingered as though their commanders
were loth to abandon the practice; but when another
half hour had passed the quivering air had
a chance to quiet down. The battle had come to
a close.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHERE HISTORY WAS BEING MADE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>That afternoon the <em>Thunderer</em> was many
miles away from the scene of the morning’s activities.
The crew busied themselves with
“cleaning up,” and both Jack and Amos were
more or less interested in watching how the monster
guns were taken care of.</p>

<p>Comparatively little damage had been done by
the bursting of shells aboard the battleship. In
fact, considering the rain of shot to which all
the vessels of the invading fleet had been subjected,
it was a matter of congratulation among
the various commanders that no serious losses
had resulted.</p>

<p>Launches were shooting this way and that as
visits were exchanged; but these were in every
case necessitated by the need of conferences, and
not mere acts of courtesy. When the war paint
was daubed on the battleships only business was<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
supposed to occupy the minds of those who were
entrusted with the charge of the many units of
the vast armada.</p>

<p>Amos had not as yet succeeded in entirely getting
rid of his headache, though he admitted
that he felt better. What he had witnessed that
morning had made a deep impression on his mind,
so that he could talk of little else.</p>

<p>They had had a good lunch in the mess-room
at about one, and later in the day, as the sun drew
nearer the watery horizon toward the west, the
boys lounged in a favorite spot on deck, surveying
the pleasing picture.</p>

<p>In every direction they could see big battleships,
swift destroyers, mine-sweepers, and
transports that had brought out new additions to
take the place of those who may have been lost,
as well as troops from both Great Britain and
France.</p>

<p>Jack had found an opportunity to make certain
inquiries, and he felt that it was time to communicate
what he had learned to his chum.</p>

<p>“I asked about the British flag we saw floating<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
at the lower extremity of Gallipoli,” he remarked,
“as well as the tricolor of France that was waving
across on the Asiatic side of the straits,
where Fort Kum Kaleh used to be. And they
tell me that some thousands of troops have been
landed there, and are entrenched, with batteries
of quick-firing guns.”</p>

<p>“Then that is why certain vessels keep within
a few miles of the straits all the time, is it?”
asked Amos. “They mean to defend the shore
parties if they are attacked by superior numbers
of the Turks.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the whole thing in a nut-shell,”
agreed Jack. “You know the fleet had little trouble
in reducing the forts and batteries on the tip
of Gallipoli to ruins in the beginning, because
they could get a clean sweep and crossfire on Seddul
Bahr and Orkhanieh. There in the ruins of
those places the handful of British soldiers are
standing at bay, ready to mow down the enemy
if he starts anything.”</p>

<p>“But why are the French over across on the
Asiatic shore, Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose only to protect the British, for they
have batteries too. But you understand, Amos,
what I was trying to find out concerned the headquarters
of the aviation corps.”</p>

<p>“Someone told me he thought it was on one of
the Greek islands lying about twenty miles away
as the crow flies,” Amos said.</p>

<p>“That may be all very true, but on the other
hand I’ve heard there have been men landed in
another quarter of the peninsula, part way up,
and my informant assured me he believed some
of the fliers made their start from one of the two
camps.”</p>

<p>“That would be important news, if only we
knew it to be true, Jack.”</p>

<p>“It would mean that we must manage to get
ashore some way or other, and find out for ourselves,
Amos. We’ve never made it a point to
depend on others when we had a thing to be done,
like the old farmer did, you remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I’ve heard the story, Jack, but
it wouldn’t do any harm to tell it again,” suggested
Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! it is meant to show how foolish it is to
think others will do things as well as you can
yourself,” Jack commenced. “You see, it is
something of a fairy story, too, and concerns a
mother bird that had her little brood nearly ready
for flying, with the nest concealed among the ripening
grain of a farmer.”</p>

<p>“A dangerous place to build a nest, that’s
sure,” observed Amos.</p>

<p>“One day when she came home the youngsters
were in a great fright, for they said the farmer
and his son had been walking close by, and declared
the grain was ready to be cut, so they
would send around for the neighbors, and start
in on the next day. After she had managed to
quiet her excited little brood the mother bird told
them there was no need of worry, for the grain
would not be cut.</p>

<p>“The next day when she came home they were
as badly scared as before. The farmer and his
son had been around again, and this time the old
man declared that since their neighbors had all
been too busy to respond, he would have to call<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
in his relatives, and get the wheat cut on the following
day.”</p>

<p>Amos laughed.</p>

<p>“Chances were it wasn’t cut, Jack?” he remarked,
sensibly.</p>

<p>“Well, she told them there was no danger,
Amos; but when on the third day the mother
bird came home, and the nestlings told her what
had happened, it was different. The farmer had
said that since neighbors and relatives had failed
them, on the following day he and his son would
have to take off their coats and reap the grain
themselves. ‘It’s time we were going then, children,’
said the wise mother bird, ‘for when a man
says he will do a thing himself, and stops depending
on others, that settles it.’ And there’s the
story, though I’m afraid it’s a chestnut.”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Jack, I never heard it before,
though it’s a cracking good one, and illustrates
the point you were making. But ever since we’ve
been going together we’ve tried to do things ourselves,
and depend on others just as little as possible.
We’ll do it again in this case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take the first chance I can find to have
a little talk with the commander,” ventured
Jack.</p>

<p>“About our getting ashore, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jack, “for it isn’t the easiest
thing going, you can understand, making a landing,
when a thousand enemy eyes may be on the
watch. First thing you know they may open
on you with a quick-firer, and your name will be
Dennis.”</p>

<p>“Still, they must have some way of communicating
with the forces ashore, and sending ammunition
as well as provisions to them,” urged
Amos.</p>

<p>“I imagine all that is done under cover of
darkness, when a landing can be made without
drawing the fire of the enemy. With every light
out one of these small dispatch boats can creep
in close enough to send a boat-load ashore. Perhaps
some of these transports that look as if they
had come a long distance may be loaded with
more Australian or New Zealand troops.”</p>

<p>“They’re coming from all over the world to<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
take a hand in this fierce scrap, it seems,” suggested
Amos. “Canadians, Hindoos, New Zealanders
they call Kiwis and Australians known
as Kangaroos, Algerians, Egyptians, Senegalese,
and lots of others. It is a world war, sure
enough, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Just stop and think of it for a minute,” urged
Jack, shaking his head as the immensity of the
titanic struggle struck him. “Besides Belgium,
Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and France,
there is Russia, with dozens of different tribes,
and Austria with a patchwork lot of peoples.
Then little Servia, and still smaller Montenegro
are fighting. Italy is bound to get in the scrap
at any day now, and before the end comes the
Turk may find Rumania and Greece at his throat,
eager to help kick him out of Europe.”</p>

<p>“No one knows yet what the end will be,”
Amos continued in the same strain. “Even Holland,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland
may be dragged into the row. I only hope
the good old United States is able to keep out of
it, that’s all. We don’t want to fight the Germans<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
if we can help it, because we think too much
of them as a people.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never go in unless we are forced to,”
declared Jack. “The only thing I’m afraid may
get us there is this submarine warfare which
Germany has started. They are torpedoing passenger
steamers, and when some Americans are
drowned Uncle Sam is apt to get riled, you know,
and roll up his sleeves for business.”</p>

<p>They sat there chatting in this strain for some
time. It was impossible to ever tire of the wonderful
scene spread before them, with all those
vessels that represented the vast sea power of
Great Britain and France moving to and fro.</p>

<p>“Germany keeps her fleet shut up in the Kiel
Canal all the time. What do you suppose their
object is, Jack?” Amos asked after a while.</p>

<p>“They are waiting in hopes of crippling the
British fleet by use of the submarines and mines,”
he was told. “Already several old battleships
have been lost out here, and others have been
sunk closer at home. But I’ve been told that so
many super-dreadnaughts have been finished<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
since the war began that the British fleet is
ever so much stronger today than early last
August when the shadow of war fell across
Europe.”</p>

<p>“All German commerce has been driven from
the sea routes,” said Amos; “and what vessels
have escaped capture are hiding in different
friendly ports. Why, over in New York, you remember,
we saw nearly a dozen splendid big
steamers that haven’t earned a dollar since July
last. And they daren’t go outside the harbor
either.”</p>

<p>“For a pretty good reason, too,” chuckled the
other. “Didn’t we see three British cruisers,
stripped for action, hovering near by when we
passed Sandy Hook lightship on our way out?
They would soon riddle the biggest German vessel,
and sink her, if there was any attempt made
at getting out. The sea just at present doesn’t
belong to the Kaiser.”</p>

<p>“I can see the Vice-Admiral standing by himself
up on the bridge,” Amos remarked just then.
“If only you could catch his eye he might beckon<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
to you to join him there, for I fancy he’s taken
a great liking to you, Jack.”</p>

<p>“That would give me the opening I wanted, to
ask a favor of him about being put ashore,
wouldn’t it, Amos? Besides, he would be likely
to know about where aviation headquarters
might be found.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like trying, Jack; and here’s wishing
you luck.”</p>

<p>Jack managed to stroll forward until near the
bridge. He stood there, keeping an eye on the
figure in the admiral’s uniform. Apparently the
commander was using his binoculars to some
purpose, possibly locating certain units of the
fleet so as to know which way to look for any
orders that might come from the one in supreme
control, while darkness rested on the sea.</p>

<p>Something caused him to glance downward
after a little while, and seeing Jack saluting him,
he smiled. Then, just as Amos had prophesied,
he beckoned the boy to ascend to the bridge and
join him.</p>

<p>Amos laughed softly when he saw this.<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
Doubtless he was saying to himself that he was
a good guesser, since he had made a bull’s-eye the
first shot. He watched Jack join the commander,
who immediately engaged him in earnest conversation,
pointing out certain warships as
though telling Jack what they had accomplished.
Then Jack must have started to mention what
he and his comrade wished to do, for the Vice-Admiral
seemed to be listening, occasionally saying
something as the opportunity arose.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Amos remarked, in a satisfied
tone. “I know he’ll do nearly anything Jack asks
of him, because my chum has such a <em>convincing</em>
way about him, he can nearly always carry his
point. And it may be we’ll not be aboard the
bully old <em>Thunderer</em> when dawn breaks, though
that remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>A short time afterwards he saw Jack again
salute the grizzled commander, and start down
from the bridge, while the officer again used his
glass to locate the most prominent units of the
big fleet of war vessels.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AFTER DARKNESS FELL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“You see I was right about his asking you up
on the bridge, Jack. What sort of luck did you
have?” demanded Amos, when his chum joined
him on deck.</p>

<p>“Good enough in some ways, though he
couldn’t tell me positively whether there would
be an aviation camp ashore,” Jack replied. “He
did mention one on an island quite some ways
off, where the injured war vessels are taken for
temporary repairs. I made up my mind that
since we had the chance we’d better go ashore
first. If it turns out that there are no aeroplane
pilots in camp we can find a way to come back
again; and he says he’ll see we get to the island
all right.”</p>

<p>“I felt it in my bones you could get nearly anything
you wanted out of the Vice-Admiral,”
boasted Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“As far as that goes,” the other told him, “I
rather believe it was the paper we carry, signed
by Kitchener, that did the trick. Every British
officer on sea or land we’ve let look at that signature
has acted as if he couldn’t do too much
for the boys K. of K. wanted to help.”</p>

<p>“But how about getting ashore, and when can
we go, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Here’s the way it stands,” came the reply.
“Some time late tonight, after twelve, he said,
there will come up a dispatch boat that is expected
to run over to the peninsula, and make
a landing, carrying orders, and other things,
too.”</p>

<p>“And we can go aboard that, can we?” questioned
Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes, the kind Vice-Admiral will have it all
arranged for us. He also means to give us a
document that will help us when we want to leave
the peninsula again, no matter whether we’ve
found Frank or not.”</p>

<p>“Good for him, Jack. One of the best things
we seem to run up against is this finding a friend<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
when in need. It’s all cut and dried now, then,
and we can count on getting ashore before morning
breaks.”</p>

<p>“Barring accidents, Amos.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that?” asked the
other, curiously.</p>

<p>“Stop and think how much risk hangs over a
landing on the rocky peninsula, when sharp-eyed
Turkish soldiers are on guard everywhere by
tens of thousands, and all sorts of barbed wire
entanglements have been set to trap the unwary.
These landings are mighty dangerous affairs at
the best, I understand.”</p>

<p>“They must be,” Amos admitted readily
enough, “when any minute you may find yourself
made a target for a quick-firer that shoots
bullets as fast as you can wink, and cuts men
down like ripe grain. But the darkness is in our
favor, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and in spite of the danger some thousands
of British soldiers and Territorials are
ashore right now, ready to fight to the last gasp
so as to hold the bit of enemy land they are squatted<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
on. When the sun comes up I count on being
with them.”</p>

<p>“And then we may know if Frank is there or
not,” added Amos, fervently, for that one consideration
was ever foremost in his mind.</p>

<p>The two comrades had been seeking the missing
one so long now, and met with so many disappointments
just when success seemed within
their grasp, that Amos could hardly be blamed
for feeling terribly despondent at times.</p>

<p>That was where having a cheery chum came
in, for Jack had buoyed his spirits up many a
time when Amos felt that the outlook was “as
blue as indigo.”</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore away and the sun sank
to rest, the boys took note of the fact that all
signs seemed to promise a good day on the morrow.
This counted for considerable with them;
for according to all reports there had been a season
of fogs and even storms recently that had
held up the work of reducing the forts defending
the waterway to Constantinople.</p>

<p>“In spite of the stars we’ll have overhead,”<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
said Jack, “I think the night will be a dark
one.”</p>

<p>“All the better for our landing, I should say,”
was Amos’ comment.</p>

<p>They had been watching the preparations
made by some of the battleships to meet the constant
danger from a submarine, for of late it had
been rumored that the Germans had succeeded
in shipping an undersea boat in sections through
Bulgaria, and that it might be heard from any
day.</p>

<p>Since that time one of the larger submersibles
is said to have made the long water trip past Gibraltar,
and the entire length of the Mediterranean,
arriving unexpectedly in time to do terrible
damage among the Allied fleets; but earlier in the
summer even the threat of hidden peril gave the
commander of the flotilla grave concern.</p>

<p>In some cases nets were used to protect a vessel
lying to or drifting; but as a rule their greatest
protection lay in an utter absence of lights
aboard. Like grim shadows the floating batteries
lay here and there on the sea, ready with<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
steam up to move at any time. The destroyers
hovered near by, constantly on guard; and from
time to time brilliant searchlights would sweep
the surroundings so thoroughly that not even a
rowboat could escape their penetrating ray.</p>

<p>It can be easily understood that these arrangements
so deeply interested the two boys that they
could not bear to leave the deck until told by a
steward that supper was waiting in the mess-room.
That appealed strongly to Amos, whose
appetite, always fair, had been considerably
sharpened by the salt sea air.</p>

<p>The officers whom they met at supper were a
very kindly set. They had heard enough about
the American lads to feel considerable interest
in their fortunes. Besides, being men who knew
what it was to take chances, they could admire
pluck no matter where found.</p>

<p>The daring feat of Jack and his chum in capturing
the notorious blockade runner, Captain
Zenos, and his entire crew, without any outside
assistance, made the boys heroes in the eyes of
the British officers. Hence they paid them constant<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
attention, and stood ready to extend a helping
hand whenever asked.</p>

<p>Jack, always looking ahead, asked many questions
as he ate his supper. In this way he managed
to pick up much information concerning
things that bore an intimate connection with the
enterprise he and Amos had in view.</p>

<p>He had explained to him how those dangerous
night landings were effected, so as to take as few
chances as possible. One of the officers had been
ashore, it happened, and was able to tell something
concerning the nature of the rough ground
likely to be encountered, cut up in large and
small gullies that would make any advance on
the part of the troops a difficult proposition indeed.</p>

<p>Later on the boys once more sought their favorite
place on deck to spend some time in talking
matters over.</p>

<p>Night had now settled down over the sea,
though it was hardly as dark as might be expected
later on. They could make out the shadowy
outlines of one or two fighters of the fleet<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
not far away. Few sounds were heard, as silence
had been impressed upon every crew; and
such labor as could be left until morning was suspended.</p>

<p>“We must get to our bunks before a great
while,” Jack suggested, “because we can only
count on a few hours’ sleep if that dispatch boat
comes a little after midnight, as the commander
told me it would.”</p>

<p>“Did you get that little paper from him he
promised you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was handed to me while we were at the
table,” Jack replied. “Even in the midst of the
weighty matters that are holding his attention
these days the kind-hearted Vice-Admiral, who
has taken such an interest in your hunt for
Frank, didn’t forget his promise.”</p>

<p>“We were certainly born under a lucky star, to
have such good friends raised up for us right
along,” laughed Amos.</p>

<p>“If we fail to find Frank on Gallipoli,” Jack
declared, “we can get aboard the <em>Thunderer</em>
again and make a fresh start. You understand<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
the great favor granted to us, for as a rule no
civilian is ever allowed on British battleships in
war times, and especially in the midst of work
like that we’ve seen today.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty fine thing to have a smooth
tongue, and a convincing way about you, let me
tell you, Jack, old chum.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested the other, “from my way of
looking at it all my abilities would have counted
for very little if we hadn’t been fortunate enough
to capture that gun-running vessel and turn the
stuff over to the Allies. You see that old rascal
of a Captain Zenos has something of a name as
a sharp character. They have never been able
to catch him, even though they knew he was carrying
explosives and guns to the Turks right
along. And they think we have earned all we
are getting from the Vice-Admiral.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I can say is that it feels good to be
appreciated,” Amos concluded.</p>

<p>They found themselves getting sleepy before
long. Of late their rest had been sadly broken,
and besides they expected to be aroused before<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
many hours. So when Jack proposed that they
say good-night to the outside world and seek
their little quarters where they had already
passed one comfortable night, Amos offered no
objection.</p>

<p>The last look around showed them only a few
vivid lanes of white light traveling this way and
that, and which would keep up all through the
weary watches of that long night&mdash;searchlights
seeking signs of a foe that might try to creep out
and spread consternation and destruction among
the numerous warships of the fleet. All else was
by this time swathed in the utter gloom that had
come as the night deepened.</p>

<p>Whoever the unfortunate officer was who had
been invalided home, the boys considered themselves
very lucky to be given his comfortable
quarters. If they were a little crowded for space
that did not matter, and they were used to bunking
together, so this fact gave them no concern.</p>

<p>They made themselves ready so that little time
might be wasted when the call came; for they had<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
been told that someone would arouse them when
the dispatch boat arrived.</p>

<p>In fact, the boys lay down just about as they
were, never going to the trouble of even removing
their leggings or shoes.</p>

<p>Amos called it “turning in all standing,”
though he must have picked up the phrase from
some seafarer; sailors often have to throw themselves
down wet and just as they are, only too
glad to get an hour’s sleep in the midst of a storm
that by its violence has utterly worn everyone
out.</p>

<p>The battleship was very steady, partly because
of the stillness of the sea at that particular time;
had the waves been running high it would doubtless
have proven far less pleasant to “land-lubbers”
like Jack and Amos.</p>

<p>“Wake me early, mother dear,” said Amos as
he turned in, “because tomorrow will be the first
of May. Seriously speaking, Jack, if I’m so
sound asleep I don’t hear the pounding on the
door, give me a kick, will you?”</p>

<p>“You can depend on me to do the same,”<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
laughed Jack. “But there’s small danger of you
not waking. A cat couldn’t walk across the floor
without you bobbing up your head and asking
‘who’s there?’ We can have about four hours’
nap, and that will have to do us for the night.”</p>

<p>Both boys were soon asleep. There were hosts
of things they might have allowed themselves to
think about, but neither of them had ever fallen
into the bad habit of doing all their worrying
when in bed.</p>

<p>They were aroused by a rap at the door, not
a loud summons, but quite boisterous enough to
cause two heads to rise from the pillow, while
Jack called out:</p>

<p>“Hello! there, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant’s compliments, sir, and he says
the dispatch boat is coming on, and will you
please come on deck as soon as you can,” a man’s
voice replied.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, our compliments to the lieutenant,
and tell him we’ll be with him in two shakes of
a lamb’s tail,” and with these words Amos was
on his feet.</p>

<p>Amos was now glad that Jack had been so
positive about making all their arrangements
beforehand. The dispatch boat would be in
somewhat of a hurry, as the commander doubtless
had a regular schedule to be carried out;
and any unexpected delay was apt to disarrange
this.</p>

<p>“I’m ready!” sang out Amos, almost before
the marine who had aroused them according to
orders from the lieutenant, whose duty kept him
on deck at this hour, could have made his report.</p>

<p>“Same here,” came a voice from the darkness,
“and the sooner we make out to reach the deck
the better. They may object to losing even a
minute of their precious time for a couple of
Yankee boys.”</p>

<p>They knew their way perfectly, whether it
were broad daylight or in the inky darkness of<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
night. Jack had looked out for that. It was a
habit born of his woodcraft education that when
in strange quarters the first thing to be done
must be to impress every little thing on his mind&mdash;and
a very good idea for any boy to take as his
motto.</p>

<p>So they came on deck without colliding with
anything. The first thing Jack did&mdash;and this
also sprang from his two years’ experience out
on the plains&mdash;was to cast an eye aloft.</p>

<p>The stars shone brightly, even though the
world below lay shrouded in darkness. Those
stars meant much more to Jack Maxfield than
they might to the ordinary careless, happy-go-lucky
lad. He was so well acquainted with the
positions of the various planets that stood for
the signs of the zodiac that all he needed at any
time was one good look around, and he could tell
pretty closely what the hour was.</p>

<p>Knowing this strong point on the part of his
chum, Amos therefore was not at all surprised to
hear him immediately mutter:</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal later than I expected. They<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
said the boat would come any time after midnight;
but right now it’s less than two hours to
peep of dawn.”</p>

<p>“Ginger! that may play the dickens with our
plans for getting ashore, Jack!” exclaimed Amos.
It might be noticed that never for one instant
did he question the accuracy of his comrade’s
statement; for in truth he had seen the other
prove his ability to tell time by the position of the
stars again and again.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s hope not,” Jack went on to say with
his customary assurance, for he always saw the
bright side of things. “They must know what
they are doing, and just how long it’s going to
take them to run across to Gallipoli.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and, Jack, you remember the commander
assured you they would have to send a
boat in to shore, no matter what happened, for
certain things had to be delivered to the general
in charge of the Territorials. I guess it’s going
to be all right.”</p>

<p>“There’s the dispatch boat coming up now, and
with only one light showing. All these movements<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
look ghostly, let me tell you, Amos.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a good reason for every one of
them,” remarked Amos, as they watched the
swift boat drawing close to the bulky battleship.</p>

<p>“You can be sure there is,” said Jack. “If
ever there was a case where constant vigilance
is the price of safety, the British seamen know
it during these exciting days. They never can
tell when, without warning, a torpedo will smash
against the side of their war vessel, sinking it inside
of five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Or an aeroplane come sailing along overhead,
and try to drop bombs down on the deck that
might do a heap of damage. Whew! talk about
living under a strain, I bet there’ll be a lot of old-young
men after this war is over. Their hair
will turn white in a year, from the constant suspense
and worry.”</p>

<p>“There, the dispatch boat has halted, and they
are sending a boat over to us, you can see. I
make out the dip of the oars in the water, and
can just barely hear the same in the rowlocks.<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
We’re expected to go off in that same boat,
Amos.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later and they saw someone come
aboard. The lieutenant of the big battleship met
him and there ensued a short talk in low tones.
Doubtless he was first of all handing over something
which was to be taken ashore, possibly mail
for the Territorials from their home ports. Then
Jack guessed he must be giving the Vice-Admiral’s
orders that the two American boys be
landed at the camp, particular care being taken
to insure their safety.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards the officer belonging
to the <em>Thunderer</em> turned and made a gesture with
his hand that Jack knew must be meant for them.
Accordingly he and his comrade drew forward.</p>

<p>“You are to be put in charge of this gentleman,
who will see that you are taken ashore. It
is the admiral’s orders, and we hope you will
meet in your search with the success you certainly
deserve.”</p>

<p>The British officer would not likely say as
much as that to most strangers, but somehow<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
these two wide-awake lads had become favorites
in the mess-room during their brief stay aboard
the grim war vessel.</p>

<p>Shaking hands with the lieutenant, after he
had made the first move himself, the boys managed
to drop into the waiting boat with a fair
amount of agility. Although they may not have
been born seamen, and indeed, until lately, had
had very little to do with boats of any size, at the
same time they were naturally nimble, and athletic
as well.</p>

<p>The two sailors rowed them across to the destroyer
which was acting as a dispatch boat,
awaited their coming, lying like a bird on the
heaving bosom of the sea. They lost no time in
getting aboard, after which the boat was hoisted
with as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>Indeed, silence seemed to be at a premium in
these exciting times. Every block had apparently
been well oiled so that when the ropes
pulled through there would be no squeaking to
announce the fact. Smaller things than this have
betrayed the presence of a boat to lurking foes;<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
and evidently the order had gone forth that nothing
should be left undone to baffle those who
would only too willingly open a battery upon
them.</p>

<p>Now they were off.</p>

<p>The boys first of all noticed the difference in
motion when aboard the speedy destroyer as compared
with the bulky battleship.</p>

<p>“I guess the one might be called a bulldog and
the other a greyhound, so far as looks and speed
go,” said Amos, speaking almost in a whisper,
for everything seemed to be done in such a
ghostly fashion that he did not dare talk out in
his natural tones.</p>

<p>“But I like this much better than the other,”
Jack told him. “It makes you feel almost as if
you were flying. We are cutting through the
water at a rate of twenty miles an hour right
now, and yet you’d hardly believe it.”</p>

<p>Another stop was made, and more mail collected
or delivered. Evidently then the dispatch
boat was also being used for the mails. Amos
began to feel a little uneasy again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>“All I hope is that we don’t have to make many
more stops like this,” he muttered disconsolately,
as they strained their eyes to make out the shadowy
shape of the big sea fighter close to which
they had come to, while the boat was again lowered
and rowed away. “Ten precious minutes
each and every time would soon put us on the
ragged edge.”</p>

<p>“Oh! they know what they are doing,” Jack
assured him. “Right now I bet you the commander
of this little craft has the minutes figured
up, and understands just when he can get to
where he expects to run his boat ashore. And
you’ll find that it isn’t going to be done in broad
daylight either.”</p>

<p>Jack absolutely refused to borrow trouble. He
had perfect faith in those keen-witted officers
who had control of the war vessels. If they were
not fully competent he believed they would not be
filling the responsible positions they held in His
Majesty’s service.</p>

<p>Presently the boat returned, and was once
more hoisted aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“This time let’s hope it’s come for good,” ventured
Amos.</p>

<p>“They seem to be taking more pains at stowing
it away than before,” Jack informed him,
“and from that fact I imagine it’s going to stay
aboard for a spell. Yes, and as we start off you
may notice that they’ve changed the course by
several points.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s little escapes you, Jack, I must say.
Now that you mention it I can see that we are
running straight toward that bright star, while
before this it lay on our right. Do you think
we’re pointing into the east now?”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly that,” mused Jack; “rather
something like east-by-north would fit in better.”</p>

<p>At that Amos chuckled.</p>

<p>“Whew! what d’ye think of that now&mdash;my
chum here beginning to talk like an old salt, and
able to box the compass like any Jack Tar. By
the time we get home you’ll be a regular walking
encyclopedia of knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may,” replied the other quietly,
“but one thing sure, if I miss anything it isn’t<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
going to be my fault. Now, as we’re spinning
along at such a fast clip we had better get out
of the breeze, and stop talking so much.”</p>

<p>Amos just gloried in the speed they were making.
He mentally calculated that it must assuredly
be close on thirty miles an hour. Never in
all his life had he experienced anything like it
when aboard a boat.</p>

<p>As the minutes crept on the boys continued to
keep a bright lookout ahead. They thought several
times they could see shadowy objects on the
water, but were never quite sure whether these
were boats belonging to the fleet, or islands.
Once or twice they watched the swinging around
the circle of a powerful searchlight, no doubt
aboard a sentry vessel. When it fell on the destroyer
and rested there, they knew full well signals
were set to disclose their identity. Then
the dazzling shaft passed on as though the workers
of the searchlight had become convinced of
their friendly mission.</p>

<p>An hour and more had gone. Amos was getting
nervous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sure it can’t be very far from peep of
dawn, Jack,” he said, crossly. “Still, we’re
shooting along as if we had the whole night
ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what those dim lights can be I make
out dead ahead,” ventured Jack, who himself
knew that the dawn was really coming on, though
he did not wish to admit as much to Amos, for
fear of increasing the other’s unrest.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, there are a number of them, too.
Try your glass on the same, Jack. It does pretty
good night work, as well as in the daytime.”</p>

<p>A minute later and Jack made an announcement.</p>

<p>“As near as I can make out they seem to be
smouldering camp-fires, Amos.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that must mean we are in sight of the
camp of the Territorials&mdash;those fellows from the
other side of the world, Australia, New Zealand
and perhaps South Africa. Then it can’t be long
now before we get in close enough to launch a
boat, and start for the shore.”</p>

<p>The minutes passed. Jack saw the darkness<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
was beginning to be dissipated; already the gray
of dawn had come. His flesh tingled with eagerness
to learn what difference that would make.
Possibly the enemy was kept at a sufficient distance
from the landing place by the presence of
the troops ashore, so that it was really safe to
use a small boat without any great risk, even
in the gray mists of early dawn.</p>

<p>“Oh! see what the sailors are pointing at over
there, Jack!” suddenly exclaimed Amos. “It
looks like a pole sticking out of the water, only
it’s moving all the time. Jack, I wonder now can
that be the periscope of one of those terrible submarines?”</p>

<p>And Jack, fastening his eyes on the odd sight,
hastened to add:</p>

<p>“It seems almost too strange to be true, Amos,
but I do believe you’re right!”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LANDING UNDER FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Those aboard the destroyer had doubtless
been on the watch for just such a sight as this
for many weeks. Every seaman had been carefully
drilled how to use his eyes in order to distinguish
what the periscope of a submersible
would look like if he ever had the luck to discover
one sticking out of the water.</p>

<p>Jack and Amos, after making sure that this
was indeed what they saw, closed their hands
tight as a sensation akin to alarm passed over
them. Would the submarine actually waste one
of her valuable torpedoes on the small enemy, a
destroyer? They were more inclined to believe
the under-sea boat would be apt to dive, and thus
slip away from danger.</p>

<p>Orders were hastily given. The speed of the
boat suddenly changed as though it were a part
of the scheme to confuse the Germans, who<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
might even then be observing them by means of
their periscope.</p>

<p>But this was not to be the sum total of the destroyer’s
programme. There came a sudden
burst of firing, and the boys saw the water
churned into foam around the spot where a few
seconds before that queer tube had been sighted.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen of the under-sea boat,
which had evidently gone down after its custom.
Already the destroyer had commenced to circle
around the place, and everyone aboard strained
his eyesight in order to see whether the first sign
of the volley from the small guns had succeeded
in its mission.</p>

<p>“Why, how still the water seems to be here,”
remarked Amos. “Yet all around us the sea is
moving in choppy little waves.”</p>

<p>“There may be a reason for that,” said Jack.
“You know that sometimes vessels in distress
during a storm at sea have found it worth while
to tow a bag of oil after them. It helps to smooth
the breaking billows a good deal.”</p>

<p>“But how would oil come here, Jack, because<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
we haven’t thrown any&mdash;oh! do you mean it
looks as if the submarine had been struck when
they sent that volley at the periscope?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean, and if you listen to
what the men are saying you’ll see they think the
same way,” Jack asserted.</p>

<p>“And if the boat was struck it may never come
to the surface again, which would make a lot of
jackies in the big fleet happy, I guess,” Amos
concluded.</p>

<p>The destroyer circled the spot several times,
but nothing was seen beyond some bubbles, and
the oil on the surface of the sea. If the submarine
had been wrecked they would never know
it, because it must stay on the bottom of the sea,
and the crew be suffocated as time passed. On
the other hand, if it had not been seriously injured
by now it was far away, and proceeding
under the surface, perhaps heading so as to get
at one of the battleships.</p>

<p>One of the first things to be done after communications
with the shore had been effected
would be to let the commander of the fleet know<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
about the presence of a small submarine, so that
all extra precautions might be taken against a
surprise.</p>

<p>“What happened, do you think, Jack?” wondered
Amos, the gunners ready to let fly with
another volley at the first sign of the enemy under-sea
boat.</p>

<p>“Ask me something easy, please,” he was told.
“They’re all hoping the submarine got her death
wound, and will never come up again. I’m a little
skeptical about that. It wouldn’t surprise me
any to hear that before long some warship, perhaps
a big one at that, had been torpedoed.”</p>

<p>“Those Germans are seldom caught asleep at
the switch, are they?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Oh! they’re no better, no worse than others, I
take it. The best of them will get caught napping
sometimes. When they poked their periscope out
so as to take a look around with the coming of
daylight they never dreamed a sassy little destroyer
was within a hundred feet of them.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they saw us, Jack?”</p>

<p>“As like as not they did, which would account<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
for the hurry they showed at sinking again. But
the shot covered every foot of the water around
where we saw that spying tube. And these gunners
have all been instructed just how to shoot
so as to bring about the destruction of a submersible.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re giving it up, you see, Jack, and
once more heading toward the lights ashore. I
can see them much better now, so I reckon all this
firing must have aroused the campers, who are
starting up their fires, thinking of breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Another thing you notice, Amos, we’re not
going straight any longer, but with a distinct
wiggle, turning first to the right and then to the
left.”</p>

<p>“Then, after all, they’re not so sure about that
submarine, and this motion is for the purpose of
avoiding being struck by a torpedo,” Amos suggested,
as though he considered that ample explanation
for the queer movements of the destroyer.</p>

<p>“No, you’re wrong there,” his chum explained.
“I think they’ve got in mind the Turks ashore,<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
who must have a number of batteries mounted
back yonder.”</p>

<p>“You mean they half expect to be shot at from
now on?” Amos asked.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we were,”
Jack admitted. “Thanks to the sea fog that is
drifting along the edge of the shore, they will
have some trouble locating us. The commander
knows what he’s about, you can depend on it,
Amos. And I’m not going to worry any more
than I can help.”</p>

<p>They were by this time approaching the shore,
which they could see was inclined to be rocky and
very rough. A shallow beach ran along under
the little bluff, however, and a landing could be
easily effected if they were not subjected to a
hot bombardment from rapid-fire guns.</p>

<p>As Jack had said more than once, the soldiers
ashore knew very well how absolutely necessary
it was that they should be able to communicate
with the fleet; and on this account he believed
they had pushed forward far enough to render
a landing fairly safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>Before the destroyer came to a stop there was
heard the heavy report of a gun somewhere up
on the hillside a mile or so. This was followed
by a great splash quite some distance away from
them, showing that the missile must have been
sent almost at random, or else the gun from
which it came had been wretchedly aimed by
the Turkish gunners in charge.</p>

<p>“No German sent that compliment to us,” asserted
Jack, who had a high opinion of the Kaiser’s
artillerymen, from having seen some remarkable
results of their gunfire on the western
front.</p>

<p>“If it was a Turk I only hope his eyesight
keeps on being poor,” voiced Amos, wondering
what it would feel like should a shell strike the
destroyer fairly amidships, though he certainly
had no desire to experience the sensation.</p>

<p>The light was getting stronger now. They,
it seemed, had wasted some time in circling
around while searching for signs of the submarine,
and only for this the boys might have been
safely ashore before then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“They’re getting ready to drop the boat overboard,”
Amos remarked a minute later. “That
means we’re going ashore. I can see some soldiers
under the little bluff, and they seem to be
watching us, as if they know we are fetching
them news from home. There, I saw a chap toss
packages of mail into the boat, which explains
the main reason we’re landing here.”</p>

<p>“One of the men ashore has a bag in his hand,
which may contain letters some of them have
written,” Jack was saying. “I wonder if it’s
really true that every letter has to be left open,
so no news of importance could be picked up by
the enemy. You know over in England they’ve
gone daffy over the German spy scare; and one
of the Tommies out here might give things
away.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Jack, let’s shove along so as to be
ready to jump in when we’re given the word.”</p>

<p>“Afraid we may be left, are you, Amos? But
it’s just as well to be ready, and then no blame
for the delay can be put on our shoulders.”</p>

<p>Another shot came from the Turkish battery<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
on the slope of the hill. Perhaps by now the
enemy had caught a glimpse of the gray destroyer
through the little wisps of sea fog that
were floating past. At any rate, the shell fell
much closer than that first one had, a fact Amos
viewed with more or less displeasure.</p>

<p>“They’re sure getting the range, Jack. If they
keep on improving that way, by the time the
fourth shell comes along it’s going to splash water
over us, if nothing worse.”</p>

<p>“But before then we’ll be in the small boat,
and pulling as fast as anything for the shore,”
he was told; for Jack could always find a way
to dissipate those depressing fears that assailed
his comrade.</p>

<p>In fact, even before the destroyer had fully
stopped moving the rowboat was dropped overboard,
and a couple of men sprang into it. The
same officer who had taken the boys from the
battleship motioned them to follow suit, which
they did without the loss of a second, after which
he took his place in the stern and the boat started.</p>

<p>Jack and his companion were seated in the<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
bow. They had an uninterrupted view of the
land, and could see everything that went on in
that quarter.</p>

<p>Amos hoped the Turks might have lost sight
of them by now, what with the sea fog, and the
fact that the dawn was only coming on. He
dreaded the possibility of being made a target
for one of those terrible quick-firers that could
rattle off the shots like hail beating on a tin roof.</p>

<p>As he sat there he was staring as hard as he
could up beyond the little bluff back of the scanty
beach. Glimpses of the distant hillside where
the enemy lay in ambush could be caught; and
since those in hiding were doubtless able to see
as well on their part, the boy wondered whether
their feeling of security might not turn out to be
short-lived.</p>

<p>He knew they must take what came, since
there was no way of “ducking” so as to avoid
the shower of missiles. Again came that startling
flash of fire far up the hillside. Amos involuntarily
drew his head in just as if that could
do him any good. Jack, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
turned to glance back at the destroyer, for he
felt it reasonable to believe the Turks would be
more likely to spend their precious ammunition
trying to sink a war vessel, than in smashing so
small an object as a mail rowboat with just five
occupants.</p>

<p>It was as he suspected. He saw the splash as
the missile struck the water, and close to the destroyer,
too. The saucy little war vessel had been
waiting for this, and immediately fired a volley
from her guns. Doubtless small damage, if any,
could be effected, for the Turks had built earthen
barricades to protect their batteries. It would
serve as notice, however, that those aboard the
destroyer were not in the least daunted by the
bombardment.</p>

<p>At the same time the vessel was seen to be in
motion. It was the intention of the commander
to take no chances. He could run out a mile or
so to sea, and await a signal from those going
ashore, when once more the destroyer would
come in so as to pick up the boat.</p>

<p>With lusty strokes the two rowers bent to their<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
oars, and the boat made rapid progress toward
the beach where a landing was intended to be
made. If all went well for a few minutes Jack
felt that they would be under the shelter of that
bluff, and hence out of range of the enemy’s
guns. But to Amos those minutes seemed the
longest he had ever known; at every second he
half expected hearing a crash that would announce
the opening of new trouble.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE GALLANT TERRITORIALS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“They’ve discovered what’s going on!”</p>

<p>Amos made this muttered remark in the ear
of his chum when a missile of some sort splashed
the water, so that the spray blew across their
faces.</p>

<p>Whether the shell had been fired directly at
the small boat that was being propelled toward
the shore, or simply fell short when sent after
the destroyer, they could not say, but nevertheless
it was a close shave.</p>

<p>Jack did not answer immediately. His heart
was fluttering with suspense, since there could be
no telling what might happen next. If the Turks
had really discovered the boat through the mists
of the early morning there was nothing to hinder
them from sending a hail of missiles that way
through the medium of a rapid-fire gun.</p>

<p>The two boys were not the only ones who<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
waited with more or less anxiety to discover
what their fate was to be. When nothing happened,
and seconds passed, with the shore line
drawing constantly closer, they began to breathe
more freely.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s going to be all right after all,”
ventured Amos, in a relieved tone that found an
echo in Jack’s heart.</p>

<p>“You see we get the benefit of that bluff now,”
the latter explained. “It hides us from the eyes
of the Turkish sentries. Perhaps they think
they’ve driven the destroyer off before she could
drop a boat, and they’re giving all their attention
to her right now.”</p>

<p>Whatever the reason might be, both of them
felt pleased not to attract the notice of the vigilant
enemy. They could by this time see a number
of figures dressed in khaki waiting for them
on the beach. They were, doubtless, members of
the Territorial forces who had effected this landing
some little time before, and who yearned to
welcome the boat that might be bringing them
letters from their far-away homeland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>Presently the keel ran up on the beach, and
as several stout fellows laid hold of the bow the
boat was quickly dragged well along, so that
those aboard could jump ashore without even
getting their feet wet.</p>

<p>The officer from the destroyer did not mean
to stay any longer than he could help. That
friendly mist might clear away at any minute,
when the task of getting back to his boat would
present new difficulties.</p>

<p>He said a few words to one of the men, and
the newcomers were told to accompany the latter
up the bank. The two seamen from the destroyer
were ordered to stand by the boat, as
their services would be needed presently.</p>

<p>When they made their way up the little bluff,
the boys noticed that the path led along what
seemed to be a gully. They could easily understand
why the Territorials had selected this particular
route, since it afforded them a certain
measure of protection from the vigilant eyes of
the ever-wakeful enemy.</p>

<p>Bending low, they soon found themselves on<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
a little plateau. It was sheltered from above by
rocks and trees. At the same time the boys noticed
that everyone who crossed this level always
did so in more or less haste, bending part
way over through excessive caution.</p>

<p>“It’s become a regular habit hereabouts, seems
like,” whispered Amos, always noticing things
that appeared strange to him, “to duck as you
walk. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that a lot
of fellows have paid dearly for standing up too
straight and making targets of themselves.
Then again it may be these Kangaroos from the
other side of the world have some queer ways of
their own. All the same, I’m doing it myself,
thank you.”</p>

<p>In a short time they had reached a tent that
stood under an overhanging rock. Undoubtedly
this might be called “Headquarters,” for as the
Territorials were just “hanging on,” as they
called it, at this stage in the invasion of the Gallipoli
Peninsula, they could not think of comfort,
safety being the first consideration.</p>

<p>An officer was standing at the flap of the khaki<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
tent waiting for them. Information must have
been carried to him with regard to the presence
of the destroyer, and he could readily guess that
the boat carried mail as well as instructions for
his guidance.</p>

<p>The officer who had come ashore was anxious
to start back. He quickly handed over the mail
sack he carried, and received in turn what letters
were waiting to go, at the same time remarking:</p>

<p>“These two lads are American boys who are
turned over to your care, Colonel. They will be
glad to explain how they happened to be aboard
the <em>Thunderer</em>. The Vice-Admiral confides them
to your guardianship, and begs that you will render
them all the assistance in your power. You
will pardon me, I am sure, for my brevity, but if
I am to get back safely to my boat, I shall have
to be in haste.”</p>

<p>“I trust that you will not linger a minute
longer,” remarked the stalwart Territorial officer
whom the boys had heard addressed as Colonel.
“Give my regards to the Vice-Admiral, and<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
assure him I shall take great pleasure in doing
as he requests.”</p>

<p>Without waiting any longer, the young officer
turned and began to retrace his way down to the
beach, though he did think to shake hands with
both of the boys before leaving them, wishing
them the best of good luck.</p>

<p>No sooner had he left than the Colonel spoke
to his guests.</p>

<p>“If you will be seated I may be able to give
you attention in a short time. My brave fellows
are fairly wild to hear from home, and this is
the fattest lot of mail we have had for many
days. I shall take great pleasure in listening to
your story while we eat our breakfast together;
and rest assured that if there is anything I can
do to assist you, my services are at your command.”</p>

<p>His manner was so extremely hearty that it
was not strange for the two boys to notice it.
After he had left them Amos was the first to
make a remark.</p>

<p>“Somehow I reckon there’s a considerable difference<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
between these Territorials and the Britishers.
It strikes me they resemble us Americans
a whole lot, being frank, hearty and breezy.
Anyway, I want to say right in the start I like
that Colonel first rate, and I hope he lives to go
back home again to his wife and family when
this cruel war is over; for chances are ten to one
that he has a family.”</p>

<p>Jack felt pretty much the same way, though
not accustomed to giving vent to his feelings as
readily as his cousin. The Colonel struck him
as being a fine chap, and he felt sure everything
possible would be done to advance their cause
while they were the guests of these gallant Australians.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we managed to run the gauntlet
safely,” Jack remarked, after a little time
had passed, “for when that single shot
struck the water so close to our boat I was
afraid the Turks had discovered us, and would
proceed to riddle us with a hail of bullets. It
was about as thrilling a minute as we’ve ever
passed through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>“By now the boat must be heading out from
the shore again,” said Amos, jumping to his feet
to look, immediately adding excitedly: “Yes,
there she is as sure as anything, with the men
pulling like horses. I’m afraid the mist is rising
some, and if that is so they’ll surely be seen.”</p>

<p>Jack at that got upon his feet to look, and after
a pause went on to remark:</p>

<p>“No, I think you’re mistaken there, Amos, for
it has swept down again. It seems to come and
go in flukes. You can hear the stroke of the
oars in spite of the care they use to hide the
sound.”</p>

<p>“There goes a gun up on the hill!” exclaimed
Amos. “Perhaps the Turks have such fine hearing
that they too have caught the sound of oars,
and are firing at random in hopes of striking the
boat, for that shot struck some distance away.
They could hardly hit a barn, anyway, I’m told,
except by accident.”</p>

<p>“There,” said Jack in turn, “some of the
troops are shouting, but between you and me I
believe all that row is started to hide the sound<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
of the oars. Besides, it may divert the attention
of the watching gunners, who are always expecting
a rush from these wide-awake Territorials.”</p>

<p>The boys had heard more or less about the
Australian and New Zealand troops when on
board the <em>Thunderer</em>. The brilliant work that
had already been done by the men from the antipodes
seemed to give the British the most intense
satisfaction. Backed by such stalwart
hosts from the various territories claimed by the
Mother country, from Canada, South Africa,
India and the other parts of the world, they believed
the future was certain.</p>

<p>There were no further shots fired up on the
hillside, which went to prove that the attention of
the vigilant gunners must have been diverted by
those loud yells that would have done credit, Jack
said, to a band of Western cow-punchers galloping
madly into a plains settlement after pay day
for their monthly picnic.</p>

<p>The small boat had vanished from view, and
the boys began to feel that the three occupants<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
were pretty sure to get aboard the destroyer
presently. Relieved by this cheering fact, they
felt that they could once more begin to pay attention
to other affairs.</p>

<p>“If these fellows have only managed to get a
foothold here,” remarked Amos, “I’m mighty
sure they don’t mean to be dislodged. You can
see they’ve got quick-firers a-plenty, and in time
some big guns will be put ashore. What does it
all mean, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Nobody seems to care to discuss it with us,”
replied Jack, “but I can read between the lines
that already the losses in warships the British
have suffered has begun to make them fear the
job of forcing the straits is going to be a lot
harder than was first figured on. So they’re beginning
to get ready to undertake the thing in a
different fashion.”</p>

<p>“By cutting a way across the peninsula, and
commanding the strait beyond, when they can
clean out the nest of Turks, and control things&mdash;of
course that’s what you mean; and, Jack, I
think myself that’s the only way to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>Amos spoke lightly at the time, as though he
believed that when there were sufficient forces
ashore the obstacles that confronted the Allies
could be easily brushed aside. It took months of
desperate hand-to-hand fighting, with frightful
losses on both sides, to convince the Allies that
they had one of the most difficult tasks on their
hands that ever confronted an army.</p>

<p>The Gallipoli peninsula has been admirably
fitted by nature for defense, since it consists of
elevations and gullies, with comparatively little
shelter. In these days of murderous rapid-fire
guns and explosive shells an advance under such
difficulties presents a grim choice of death, with
very little certainty of any gain save in yards
dearly purchased.</p>

<p>All this was to be learned as the summer progressed,
and fall coming on found the problem
far from solved.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Amos, suddenly, “that must
have been some sort of signal from the destroyer.
I wonder if they have taken the boat
aboard, and started back to where the big fleet<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
lies, with anchors up, waiting for the day’s work
to begin?”</p>

<p>“I think that was what it meant,” remarked
Jack. “For one, I’m glad, for that young officer
was a pretty genial fellow&mdash;for an Englishman.
As a rule they’re a queer lot, and so reserved
that until you get to understand them well you’re
apt to think them cold-blooded and uppish. But
we know different, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“From K. of K. down we’ve met with only
kindness from them,” declared Amos, with sincerity
in his voice. “I only hope and pray that we’re
fated to come on my brother Frank ashore here.”</p>

<p>“If not, we’ll get back to the <em>Thunderer</em> tomorrow
night, if possible, and then try to reach
that Greek island where some of the seaplanes
start from when doing their little daily stunt.
But here comes the Colonel. Perhaps he’s found
time to listen to what we have to tell him.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<span id="Page_185" class="pagenum">[185]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A COLONEL OF THE “KANGAROOS.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Colonel, however, did not stop beside
them. He evidently had letters to read, and
wished to look them over in the seclusion of his
tent.</p>

<p>“We will be having breakfast before long,” he
remarked to the two boys on passing, “and I
shall expect you to be my guests for the time
being. While we eat our scanty meal you can tell
me all you wish me to know.”</p>

<p>Here and there the fires had been built up
again, and preparations were proceeding for the
morning meal. This interested the boys. They
had their customary appetites with them; and,
besides, were amused to see how differently these
men from the other side of the world went about
certain things in connection with cooking.</p>

<p>It was not long before enticing odors began
to arrive that caused Amos to express himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>“They know how to cook, let me tell you, Jack,
even if their way of building a camp fireplace
does look queer to us. I suppose different people
have different ways of doing things. The
result is, after all, the main thing, and if these
splendid whiffs I’m getting mean anything I’ve
got something to learn still.”</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when the Colonel came
out of his tent again. Jack thought he looked
as though he had had good news from home,
for his eyes sparkled, and a smile could be seen
on his bronzed face.</p>

<p>“Now, if you young chaps will sit down with
me here at my camp table, we can talk while we
eat,” he remarked as he joined them.</p>

<p>No one seemed to be at mess with the Colonel.
Perhaps this was because they had duties elsewhere;
or else he had let it be understood that he
wished to be alone with the two American boys
who had come from the <em>Thunderer</em>, bent on
some mysterious errand that was yet to be made
plain to him.</p>

<p>For a short time the conversation was on<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
general topics. The officer asked many questions,
for he had not been in touch with the great
outside world for weeks, and was naturally
deeply interested in what might be going on
across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“I have been through your wonderful country
years back,” he explained, as if to let them know
why he took such an interest in America; “and
I think it leads the whole world in many things.
Most of us are hoping and praying that in this
terrible world war that means everything to
those who come after us, the Allies have the
sympathy of the vast majority of your mixed
people. Of course we recognize that nearly all
who have Teuton blood in their veins would naturally
side with our enemies.”</p>

<p>The boys assured him that as far as they knew
that was the way things stood at the time they
left home.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued the officer, kindly, “all
I know about you is your names, so if you feel
disposed to tell me what the Vice-Admiral wishes
me to do for you I shall gladly take the matter<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
up, and act upon it, after today sees us through
what we have laid out to perform.”</p>

<p>This was an invitation to begin at the start so
as to tell him about Frank Turner, and how it
happened he came to be turned out of his home
some years back. Jack took it upon himself to
be the spokesman, for Amos had insisted on this
arrangement. He knew that Jack could gain
more favors through his winning manner than
he might ever expect to have come to him.</p>

<p>Jack did not enter too deeply into particulars.
There was no need for them. When he spoke
of Amos’ father having known Lord Kitchener
long ago, and then handed the Territorial officer
that wonderful paper which was now almost
going to tatters through long handling,
just as both boys expected, the result was all
they could have hoped for.</p>

<p>After that Jack told how they had made their
way along through that section of Belgium held
by the Allies; and then, learning that Frank had
gone to Northern France, searched for him there
also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>No doubt the Colonel was astute enough to
realize that the chums must have undergone
many hardships, and encountered numerous
perils while trying to get on the track of the
missing Frank. He did not ask for incidents,
however. If, later on, the boys cared to go
deeper into details he would be only too well
pleased to listen; but just now the rough outlines
of the case satisfied him.</p>

<p>How his eyes sparkled when Jack modestly
told of their latest adventure. Like most others
who were in the Dardanelles fight, the Colonel
had heard wonderful stories concerning the
blockade-runner, Captain Zenos; and it astonished
him beyond measure to hear Jack tell how
he and his chum had trapped the cunning Greek,
and finally turned his cargo and powerboat over
to the Allies.</p>

<p>Before the story had been barely finished he
was insisting on shaking hands with the two
American lads, after his breezy fashion.</p>

<p>“I am more than proud to have met you, to
shake hands with you!” he declared. “You are<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
boys after my own heart. I can conceive of
nothing finer than the trick you played on Zenos;
and the only thing I regret is that you didn’t
see fit to hand him over to our people. That
man has carried a vast amount of shells to the
enemy. Many of the Allies have lost their lives
just because of him; and he would never have
run the blockade again, you can rest assured.”</p>

<p>“That was what we feared,” said Jack, “and
it bothered us to know what we ought to do.
Circumstances settled it for us. You see, he
was shut up below, with all that explosive stuff.
If he believed we meant to hand him over to
the British the chances were that, in a fit of desperation,
he might have blown the boat up, and
all of us would have perished with her.”</p>

<p>“And you made a bargain with him, did you,
promising to let him go free on condition that he
behaved himself? Well, my son, after all is said
and done that seems to have been a wise move
on your part. Zenos is a reckless scoundrel,
and he knows what would happen to him if
caught.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>The story had now been finished, and the boys
eagerly waited to hear what the Territorial officer
would have to say. He seemed to be considering
matters, since he remained silent for
quite some time.</p>

<p>“As I understand it, Amos,” he finally remarked,
turning upon the other as he spoke,
“you have good reason to believe this dashing
brother of yours is now with our force out here
at the Dardanelles?”</p>

<p>“We know he started this way, and the
chances are ten to one Frank has been doing
some of his usual daring work here. We
watched the aeroplanes and seaplanes soaring
over the Turkish forts and batteries while the
fleet was bombarding in the lower part of the
straits yesterday, and something seemed to tell
me that the one who dropped bombs into a fort,
and blew up the magazine, <em>must</em> have been my
brother.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly,” agreed the other, with a
smile, “although we have some gallant fliers of
our own stock who would hesitate at nothing.<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
Then your plan is to try and find out as soon as
possible if Frank is here?”</p>

<p>“We were given to understand that possibly
one or more of the aviators had found a convenient
base on the peninsula, though the main
body had their headquarters on one of the Greek
islands some twenty miles or more away from
here. What we planned to do was to first of all
learn whether Frank could be the one ashore,
as that would just be like his venturesome ways;
if it turned out to be another flier, then the Vice-Admiral
told us to get back to the <em>Thunderer</em> as
soon as we could, and he would send us to the
island.”</p>

<p>The Colonel was rubbing his chin after the
manner of a man who might be trying to figure
something out. Feeling sure that he would do
everything possible to further their cause, the
boys waited patiently to hear what he might have
to say when his mind was made up.</p>

<p>“I have been given to understand,” he finally
told them, “that there is one of our aviators who
has found some place where he can drop down<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
and rise again, on the shore of Gallipoli; but I
am sorry to say I have not myself seen him. I
made inquiries only yesterday and one of my
men, who has been at the camp of the New Zealanders
a mile or more above us, told me he had
seen and talked with the birdman. So I understand
that he is taking advantage of the protection
they are able to give him. The ground must
differ radically from what we have here, because
outside of one little exposed plateau there is absolutely
no place an aeroplane could make a run
to get a start when about to rise.”</p>

<p>Amos looked pleased.</p>

<p>“Oh! did he go so far as to describe the
aviator, Colonel?” he asked. “See, here is a
picture of my brother taken some years ago;
perhaps he might be able to tell me from that, if
we’re on the right track at last.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put you in touch with the man as soon
as we are done with breakfast,” advised the
obliging officer. “The chances are you will learn
the facts, one way or another.”</p>

<p>“And if he seems inclined to say it is the same<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
person, how can we manage to get up to the
other camp, Colonel?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Well, it would be utterly out of the question
to think of trying such a game in broad daylight,”
he was told. “We have no boats, you
understand, and when this private was sent off
on a mission to our fellows in the upper camp
he was guided by a Greek named Arturus, who
knows every foot of the way. He is still with
us, and might be influenced to undertake to lead
you there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not afraid in the least that he will
refuse, after my cousin has had a chance to talk
with him,” said Amos, at which the officer
laughed.</p>

<p>“I believe your faith is not misplaced, for Jack
certainly has a winning way about him,” he assured
Amos. “Even if my mind had not already
been made up to help you in every way possible,
I think I would have fallen a victim to his arguments.
I have a boy at home who is as much
like Jack here as two peas in a pod&mdash;not in looks
alone but manners as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>That partly explained why the doughty Colonel
of the Territorials had looked so earnestly and
often at Jack Maxfield. The sight of the resolute
face of the American boy had put him in
mind of his own son far away across the seas.</p>

<p>“When can we expect to take this venture,
then, sir?” asked Jack, partly to hide his confusion,
for compliments of any kind always made
him turn red in the face, and feel uneasy.</p>

<p>“If tonight offers a fair chance you shall make
the attempt,” he was told. “In the meantime you
can meet the soldier who saw this aviator in the
camp above, and also arrange with Arturus. I
shall let the Greek know that I am giving my
full permission to the enterprise, and you can
make your own terms with him.”</p>

<p>“He is to be depended on, sir?” asked Jack,
whose recent experience with Greek treachery
somehow did not make him feel kindly disposed
toward the inhabitants of the Hellenic islands.</p>

<p>“He is as true as steel, you can count on it.
That slippery customer of a Zenos is an exception
to the rule. We look on the Greeks as our<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
allies-to-be sooner or later, when the proper time
comes. And while you are here today you will
be given an opportunity to see something of the
vigorous kind of fighting we have to engage in.”</p>

<p>“Then you mean to tackle the Turks again I
take it, sir?” asked Amos, eagerly, for somehow
he had become possessed of an ardent desire to
see how these Australians fought, knowing as
he did that their ways were radically different
from those of the regular British troops; just
as their habits of dress seemed to be.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want you to promise me that you
will keep far in the rear, and not run any unnecessary
chances of getting hurt,” the Colonel
proceeded. “While as a rule these Turks are
poor marksmen, there are men among them, perhaps
Germans it may be, who can hit the bullseye,
and we have learned this to our sorrow.”</p>

<p>“We promise you, sir, not to expose ourselves,
for you know we are neutral in this awful business,”
Amos hastily remarked.</p>

<span id="Page_197" class="pagenum">[197]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TO SURPRISE THE TURKS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“And now,” said the Colonel, “if you are
through with your breakfast I will send first of
all for the private who went to the upper camp
with Arturus the Greek, and then, in turn, you
can meet the guide.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. In a very few
minutes a soldier came up and saluted, a fellow
who had discarded the leggings with which he
had come from the other side of the world, and
turned up his trouser-legs so as to keep cool, for
the weather was already feeling rather uncomfortably
warm to one accustomed to a cooler
climate.</p>

<p>Later on these men from the other side of the
world stripped half their garments off, and
fought in that “free-and-easy” fashion, as they
termed it. Some of them must have had the
blood of Scottish Highlanders in their veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“Lancing, these two young chaps are American
boys who are looking for an aviator named
Frank Turner,” the officer explained to him as
he stood there at attention, as rigid as a stick.
“They have some reason to believe he is ashore
here. You told me when you made your report
that you had spoken with an air pilot whose
aeroplane was at the camp of the New Zealanders.
Now show him the picture, Amos.”</p>

<p>Amos only too gladly complied. He fairly
held his breath while the stiffened figure of the
private put out a hand and took the photograph.
He was looking intently at it now.</p>

<p>“That picture was taken, they tell me, several
years back, Lancing,” the Colonel went on to
explain, “so naturally it might not be exactly like
the original as he is today. Now, since you have
examined it, can you say whether the man you
met and talked with resembled this picture to
any degree?”</p>

<p>“He does, sir, and he does not,” answered the
man.</p>

<p>“Still you can see no reason why they should<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
not be the same, can you? Is the color of the
hair similar, and the general features much
alike?” continued the obliging officer.</p>

<p>“On the whole, sir, I’m tempted to say I have
talked with the original of this picture,” the soldier
finally admitted. “Yes, I can see now the
odd little smile around the corners of the mouth
that I noticed in the air pilot.”</p>

<p>Amos gave a gurgle of intense satisfaction.
It seemed to him that, as Jack had declared, their
third attempt was fated to meet with the success
that had been denied to them on two previous
occasions.</p>

<p>“That will do, Lancing. When you go back
send the Greek Arturus to me. Tell him it is a
matter of great importance.”</p>

<p>He turned to the boys after the soldier had
again saluted, wheeled stiffly in his tracks, and
walked away in a machine-like fashion.</p>

<p>“It begins to look promising, I am glad to
note, Amos, and I sincerely hope you will be able
to find your brother before another daybreak.
Though, like others you have told me of, I am<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
sorry to know you mean to coax him to leave us,
in order to go home. I only trust that after he
has seen his father he will come back again and
continue his wonderful work for our cause.”</p>

<p>The Greek must have been close at hand for
he now made his appearance. Jack was favorably
impressed with his bold, resolute bearing.
He likened him to some of those old-time
worthies of whose brave exploits history teems;
and whose names are held in reverence wherever
Greeks continue to gather, for they live a good
deal in the past.</p>

<p>Arturus listened to what the Colonel had to
say. Meanwhile he was casting covert glances
toward the two boys. When he first learned that
he was expected to pilot the pair up to the other
camp, through numberless perils, he had frowned
because he deemed it a fool’s errand. The
Colonel soon disillusioned his mind on this point.</p>

<p>When Arturus learned that Jack and Amos
had actually captured, alone and single-handed,
the terrible gun-runner and his crew, as well as
turned the cargo and the boat over to the Allies,<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
his manner changed at once. He evidently knew
enough of Captain Zenos to understand that anyone
who could trap him so cleverly was not to be
treated with scorn or derision, even though mere
boys in point of years.</p>

<p>It was speedily arranged that Arturus would
pilot the Colonel’s guests to their intended destination
when night again fell upon Gallipoli.
Nothing was said as to payment, but Jack felt
sure this part of the matter could be easily settled.
With Arturus the wish of the Colonel was
as good as law; and he would have promised to
do his part even without thought of any reward.</p>

<p>The Greek made an engagement to meet them
at sundown. He would come to the Colonel’s
tent at that hour ready to explain his plan of
campaign. So he passed away, and Jack, looking
after him, noted that the man was a born woodsman,
for he planted his feet on the ground as
softly as a cat, and his eyes seemed to continually
rove from side to side as though nothing
could escape them.</p>

<p>“You will have to excuse me from now on,<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
boys, and shift for yourselves,” they were told
by the commander of the Territorial force ashore
on the peninsula. “Remember that you have
promised not to take any unnecessary risks while
observing the action today.”</p>

<p>They renewed their assurances, having no desire
to expose themselves to the marksmanship
of some German sharpshooter who might be
posted up on the hillside, eager to pick off such
of the invaders as he could discover.</p>

<p>It was not long before there were positive
signs of “something doing,” as Amos called it.
The khaki-clad men with their guns began to
gather in squads. There was evidently no attempt
going to be made to “rush” the trenches
of the Turks in the conventional way, for the
presence of those quick-firers above cooled all
such ardor.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be something like the old-time
Indian fighting over in our own country, you can
see, Jack,” asserted Amos, as he and his chum
stood and watched some of these detachments
start forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” Jack remarked, “these Territorials,
whether from South Africa, Canada or the other
side of the world, all know about those sort of
tactics. Many of them are hunters, or have been
cowboys. Others have had experience with
crafty savages, and copied some of the ways of
the heathen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good maxim to follow&mdash;‘when
you’re in Rome do as the Romans do,’” Amos
said reflectively. “They’re going to fight fire
with fire. See how they drop down in that brush,
and start to crawling along like snakes. I’m only
afraid we won’t be able to see much of this scrap
after all.”</p>

<p>“Wait a while,” his chum advised. “I reckon
that when enough of them have managed to
creep up close to the trenches of the Turks there
will be some sort of a signal given, at which
every Territorial will leap to his feet, and be
over the line like so many wolves.”</p>

<p>The anticipation of such a thrilling picture
caused Amos to quiver with eagerness. His only
regret was that he himself could not be one of the<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
select company on whom this gallant advance
was to fall; for with his reckless nature Amos
would have liked nothing better.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the Turks look for anything like
this today?” he remarked a short time later, as
they found seats where they could rest comfortably.</p>

<p>“Oh! so far as that goes, Amos, they must be
on the watch day and night, when they’re facing
these Territorials. They can never tell when
something is going to happen. But you remember
the Colonel told us they were expecting that
the enemy might be somewhat off his guard today,
because this is one of their holy days, when
the true Mohammedan fasts, and devotes a lot
of his attention to his prayer rug, bowing toward
Mecca.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s what I call a clever trick&mdash;planning
to take the Turk by surprise when his
mind’s turned on other things. We’ll soon see
whether it works or not, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Not for some hours, I’m afraid,” the other
told him. “They have a long distance to cover,<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
and very nearly every foot of the same they must
snake their way along. Then there are several
gullies lying between that must be crossed.
Likely there’ll be absolutely nothing doing for
some time.”</p>

<p>“We might look up that Arturus, and pump
him some, in order to learn what we can of
what’s ahead of us,” Amos suggested. “The
country is terribly rough all around here, and
we’re apt to have a sweet time of it making our
way to the other camp, especially in the pitch
dark, and with hawk-eyed Turks roaming around
looking for a chance to cut down the number of
their foes.”</p>

<p>Jack thought the idea worth carrying out, and
accordingly both kept watch for the Greek. It
was an hour before he came along, but seeing
Amos beckoning, he hastened to join them.</p>

<p>“We said nothing about a reward for your
services, Arturus,” Jack told him, “for the
Colonel gave us no chance to mention it. Would
you be satisfied with twenty American dollars?
We are not as well supplied with ready cash as<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
we would like, you understand, Arturus, or we
would double that amount.”</p>

<p>The young Greek smiled until he showed his
even white teeth under his black mustache.
He also shook his head vigorously in the negative.</p>

<p>“I am not thinking of the money, I assure
you,” he told them. “Listen. Once upon a time
I knew this same Captain Zenos. In fact, I was
one of his crew, and went with him on three voyages.
Then we had words, and he struck me.
See, there is a mark, just under my hair, which I
shall carry always with me. I dared not answer
him as the rage in my heart would have tempted
me to do; but I was resolved never again to sail
with him. Besides, my heart was not in the
work. I detested the cruel Turks by whom I had
lost a father and elder brother in the last war.
So you can now understand why I left Captain
Zenos.”</p>

<p>“And it’s a good thing you did, Arturus,” said
Amos, warmly. “You are on the right side now,
depend on that, and fighting for all that is worth<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
while in this world&mdash;the coming of a peace that
will last forever, it is hoped.”</p>

<p>“And after I have heard what it was you two
boys have done to my former captain,” continued
the Greek, smiling again, “I was determined to
serve you to the best of my ability. I owe you
that, and much more, because in humbling that
man you have at the same time avenged my
wrongs. So please do not speak to me of money
when I am only too glad to help you valiant
boys.”</p>

<p>They asked Arturus to sit down and chat, for
there were many things they wished to know.
These not only concerned the methods by which
the Territorials expected to surprise the Turks
on one of their fast and holy days, but also covered
the subject of their intended journey on the
coming night.</p>

<p>The Greek told them what he could of the
ground they would be compelled to pass over.
Part of the way they might expect to utilize the
sandy beach, but after getting a certain distance
from the camp there was too much danger attached<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
to that method of progression. Then it
would be necessary for them to worm their way
along, something after the manner the Territorials
did when creeping up toward the lines held
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The time dragged slowly, and it became noon.</p>

<p>Amos and Jack had been by themselves for several
hours now, Arturus going about his own
business. An oppressive silence seemed to hang
over the scene, where on the preceding day a
constant booming of great guns had made the air
quiver with the concussion.</p>

<p>“It looks like there was going to be nothing doing
from the fleet today, because we’ve hardly
had a distant glimpse of a war vessel all morning,”
Amos remarked, as he watched some of
the soldiers who had been left behind, for the
most part suffering from slight wounds, start to
prepare the midday meal.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s only to be expected,” Jack told him.
“The wear and tear on the big guns must be
something fierce. And then, you know, they have
to take on more ammunition so as to be always<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
ready for business. No, whatever goes on today
will be ashore here; and up to now we’re in the
dark just whether or not the boys can crawl up
close enough to make an attack.”</p>

<span id="Page_210" class="pagenum">[210]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE FOR THE TRENCHES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack had hardly made this remark when something
happened. Neither of the boys could fully
decide what the nature of the signal may have
been; but they were sure one must have been
given by the leader of the attacking Australians,
far up on the hillside beyond the brown level,
and the deep gullies that cut into the face of the
earth here and there.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a salvo of shrill whoops
and deeper hurrahs. It was hard to distinguish
the cries of the startled Turks from those of the
assailants coming on with an impetuous rush
from the shelter where they had been lying unseen.</p>

<p>Both boys leaped to their feet as though impelled
by hidden springs. Not for anything in
the wide world would they want to risk the
chance of losing the wonderful spectacle of that<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
assault, so cleverly planned, and so skillfully carried
out. It looked from the start as though the
wily Turks had for once been caught napping.
The smart tactics of these “Kangaroos” from
the other side of the world had been too much
for them.</p>

<p>Just as the boys had mentioned, this was one
of the days when all true believers of the Prophet
fasted, and ever so many times made use of their
prayer rugs in order to show their faith in Mahomet
and Allah.</p>

<p>It was a day when their duties were apt to
hang lightly upon their consciences, and unless
attacked they had no heart for fighting. But a
Turk has never been known to be a quitter; history
has ever reckoned him a cruel man, but never
a coward. Consequently at the first sign of an
attack the defenders of the rude trenches up
there on the hillside flew to their posts, and prepared
to sell their lives dearly.</p>

<p>If any of the Allies believed the Turks, being
disorganized, and smarting from recent defeats
at the hands of the little Balkan States, would<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
prove to be an “easy mark,” they soon learned
their mistake. It cost them a multitude of men
to find this out, as the depleted ranks of their
regiments amply proves.</p>

<p>From where Jack and Amos stood they had a
pretty fair view of the side of the slope where the
fighting was going on. They had selected this
position purposely, having been assured that it
was as good as could be found.</p>

<p>Amos, quivering with a queer sensation, that
may have been a love for excitement, instantly
burst forth with expressions of mingled amazement
and admiration.</p>

<p>“Oh! did you ever dream anything could be as
fierce as that, Jack? Look how in twenty places
at once they are fighting at close grips, just like
they used to do in the old days before the quick-firers
came into play. It’s a case of bayonet
against bayonet. And the same thing must be
going on along the whole line, even if we can’t
see it all!”</p>

<p>“It makes my blood run cold, I tell you!” exclaimed
Jack, who was paler than usual, while he<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
had his jaws set, as though forcing himself to
continue looking at the terrible spectacle of men
scrambling about up there on that elevation, each
fairly wild to do material damage to his sworn
foes, though he lost his own life in the undertaking.</p>

<p>“One thing you can bet on,” continued the irrepressible
Amos. “This quick rush of the Kangaroos
has made all the Turks’ German rapid-fire
guns next door to useless. They are all right
when the enemy is rushing the fort or the
trenches in solid ranks, or even in detached
bunches; but when it’s a case of every man for
himself they become next door to old junk.”</p>

<p>“They’re not trying to use them that I can see,
as far as the open lies,” said Jack, speaking very
loud, for the jumble of fierce sounds welling down
from the fighting line rendered ordinary conversation
impossible.</p>

<p>“Oh! did you see that soldier rush the Turk
down with his bayonet?” Amos went on exclaiming,
as though finding a vent for his feverish
anxieties in thus commenting on the progress<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
of the battle for the trenches. “I was afraid the
man above would prove to have the longer reach,
but just at the last second the Kangaroo jumped
into the air, just like the animal he’s named after
does, and came at the Turk from a direction he
hadn’t expected. And, Jack, the Turk went down
like grass before the scythe.”</p>

<p>Fascinated by the amazing sight, they continued
to stand there and use their eyes to the
best advantage. Up to this moment Jack had
apparently forgotten all about the glasses he carried
in a small case, binoculars of the best make,
and which had proved a valuable asset on numerous
former occasions.</p>

<p>Indeed it was Amos who suddenly reminded
him of the fact that he was losing a good opportunity
to view some of these sanguinary doings
at close quarters; and that while they might cause
a cold shudder, still, they were apt to regret it if
they allowed the chance to pass by unimproved.</p>

<p>It might have been noticed, however, that Jack
did not show any great eagerness about making
use of the glasses. Perhaps he would rather have<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
refrained, only for the urging of his comrade;
as they saw the affair without any magnifying
it was terrible enough, Jack may have thought.</p>

<p>He looked for a brief time and then gladly
handed the binoculars over to his companion.
Amos could not help but notice that Jack’s hand
shook as with the palsy when he came in contact
with it; and this was so unusual with steady-going,
self-contained Jack that the other
could not help shooting an uneasy look at his
face.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re as white as a ghost, old fellow!”
he exclaimed in wonder. “Whatever is the matter
with you? I don’t remember seeing you like
that before in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Look for yourself,” was what Jack told him,
drawing a long breath. “Perhaps in time a fellow
might get used to such awful sights, but it
seems to send a cold shiver to my heart.”</p>

<p>Amos immediately clapped the glasses to his
own eyes. He ranged them along the limited field
of vision allowed them from below. Everywhere
it seemed as though men were wrestling furiously<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
with one another, dealing wicked blows, and
struggling like mad for the mastery.</p>

<p>It was very evident that with these dauntless
Territorials on the one side, and the fanatical
Turks, fearless of death, on the other, these gullies
and hillsides marking the topography of the
Gallipoli Peninsula would prove to be a veritable
shambles before the end came, no matter which
won out eventually.</p>

<p>Amos somehow proved to have the stronger
nerves in this crisis. It may have been that his
natural curiosity forced him to keep on looking,
even though from time to time he was compelled
to emit exclamations indicative of horror, amazement,
or wildly enthusiastic admiration.</p>

<p>They could see that in places the ground was
fairly covered with those who had already fallen.
In the midst of this scene other men still battled,
now slipping down, only to scramble erect again,
and go on with the mad struggle.</p>

<p>In one section the assailants seemed to have
carried their point, for they were climbing over
the rude trenches and the barricades which the<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
Turks had thrown up to protect themselves from
the fire of the enemy below. If the warships
shelled the camp they doubtless had holes into
which they were wont to crawl as rabbits might
seek their burrows in a storm.</p>

<p>So far it was anybody’s fight. Honors seemed
even, with the Turks holding their own at one
end of the line, and the Territorials pushing them
badly at the other. A little thing might suffice to
win the day, Jack believed.</p>

<p>“I’m only worried for fear reinforcements get
there for the Turks,” Amos was saying as he kept
the glasses glued to his eyes, being under the impression
that if Jack wished to have them again
he would ask.</p>

<p>“But you can make up your mind, Amos, that
all our men have not been allowed to get into the
fight at the start. The Colonel is too wise for
that. There must be a reserve force that can be
hurled forward when the proper time comes.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish it was right now!” cried the
other, “because it would stampede the Turks.
They’re just ready to give up, I bet you, if they<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
saw another force coming up the hill on the run.
Why doesn’t the Colonel see that, Jack? Oh!
he’s letting a golden opportunity get past him,
I’m telling you!”</p>

<p>“Trust him to know what he is doing, Amos.
A soldier has to learn tactics in battle as well as
on the drill ground. I warrant you our friend
the Colonel has a card up his sleeve, and will
show it when the right time comes. I’ve got an
idea there’s a little of the Napoleon in him, or is
it the spirit of Wellington?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s too bad, utterly too bad!” cried
Amos.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” demanded the other,
seemingly quite satisfied to have the news filtered
to him through the medium of his companion.</p>

<p>“The Turks have been reinforced, Jack! I can
see new men jumping into the fight all along the
line. Others have gathered back yonder, and
seem to be trying to pick our men off at a safe
distance. I’m afraid the Colonel waited too long.
He might have had them on the run before this;<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
and once a panic strikes in it’s hard to stop a
beaten force.”</p>

<p>“Well, these Turks seldom get into a panic,”
Jack told him. “They are more likely to fight and
die on the spot, satisfied that they are going
straight to Paradise.”</p>

<p>“But unless something happens right away it
will be much too late to count for our side,
Jack!”</p>

<p>“All right! Something <em>is</em> going to happen before
you can say Jack Robinson three times.
Look higher up, Amos! There, did you hear a
terrible crash? That came from a big bomb.
And now you see who threw it, don’t you,
Amos?”</p>

<p>“An aeroplane, Jack, soaring right along over
the battle front, dipping down low at times, then
spinning up again on a slant! See how daringly
the pilot guides his machine along. If the Turks
can spare the time to look up and fire their guns
at him, they cut only holes in the air, for he is
going like a whirlwind. There! he is about to
drop another of his bombs. I bet you the old<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
Turks are scattering like chickens when the hawk
swoops down over the field. <em>Wow!</em>”</p>

<p>This last exclamation on the part of Amos was
drowned by the terrific detonation that signaled
the arrival of the death-dealing bomb. The boys
saw a cloud of smoke instantly rise. They also
noted that in the immediate vicinity the Turks
were displaying the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>“There are things, you see, Jack,” Amos was
calling triumphantly, “that can strike terror to
the heart of even a fanatical Turk. He can get
used to meeting cold steel in the shape of bayonets,
and even the flash of guns close at hand
doesn’t <a id="Ref_220"></a>faze him; but a shell, or a bursting
bomb, makes him turn tail and run.”</p>

<p>“It does look that way, Amos,” admitted Jack,
still watching the singular train of events that
was passing before their eyes as though it might
be a panorama on a big screen.</p>

<p>“Oh! if there were only half a dozen of those
aeroplanes instead of just the lone one, I believe
they’d soon have the victory clinched. The
Turks never could stand a rain of bombs from<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
the skies, and they’d skedaddle over the brow of
the hill like scared deer.”</p>

<p>“Are you looking at the man in the flier,
Amos?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“You may be sure I am, Jack, as hard as ever
I can.”</p>

<p>“And do you think it can be your brother
Frank; because this machine must be the one we
heard had landed on the peninsula at the upper
camp?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew; I certainly would give a heap
to be sure. Jack, you see he’s got his head all
muffled up; and with goggles on even his brother
wouldn’t know him in that disguise. But something
tells me it <em>must</em> be Frank. From all we’ve
heard about his dashing work I feel that no other
air pilot could take such desperate chances as
that fellow does, and carry it through. Frank
was known for a bold boy years and years ago.
He would stay all night in a house they said was
haunted; and Jack, he found out that the noises
came from the air whistling through a knot-hole.
<em>Now</em> his scare held off the Turks. They can’t win!”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AFTER THE FIGHT WAS OVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Why do you say that, Amos?” demanded
Jack, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh! because our reinforcements have arrived,”
replied the other, exultantly. “Look further
down the hill and you’ll see them leaping
forward like tigers. They act as if wild to get
in the scrap; and when they do it’s all over with
Mr. Turk on this day. They have made up their
minds to take those trenches and they’ve just got
to do it, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Jack had felt all the thrills that such a picture
is apt to bring in its train when the heart beats
in full sympathy for one or the other of the combatants.
He had tried his best to keep from taking
sides, but found it impossible, when he believed
that the principles for which the Allies
were fighting were the same as those of the big
republic across the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>It was easily possible for him to see the new
line of the Kangaroos bounding impetuously up
the side of the slope; binoculars were not needed
to disclose their furious rush. The sunlight
gleaming on their set bayonets caused them to
glitter as though set with diamonds; but, alas!
they would not always remain so bright.</p>

<p>Jack watched with his heart beating much
faster than its wont. He wondered if, when
those new men reached the fighting line, they
would carry all before them. The loud cries of
Amos broke in upon his figuring.</p>

<p>“I can see German officers up there, Jack, as
sure as anything!” he exclaimed. “Oh! I know
them from their uniforms, and the way they
act. They are even beating some of the poor
Turks to make them fight harder. Oh! what d’ye
think, one of them actually shot a fellow who
may have been running away. That shows the
Germans are the masters here.”</p>

<p>Jack was glad he had not seen what his chum
was describing so vividly. There were enough
terrible things to be discovered without that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>By now the newcomers had struck the line.
Their rush was fully as impetuous as any football
squad had ever used to carry things before it.
Indeed, doubtless many of those fighters from
the other side of the world were used to the tactics
of the gridiron, and could apply their knowledge
of formations to good advantage, even on
the field of battle.</p>

<p>The influence of the supporting column was
immediately felt. Where the Kangaroos had begun
to waver their line was stiffened. Men who
had felt themselves almost at the point of succumbing
received a new stimulus, and with fresh
shouts once more threw themselves upon the staggering
foe.</p>

<p>The coming of the lone aeroplane had in a
measure discounted the addition to the ranks of
the Turks. They evidently knew they could expect
no other reinforcements, and the fact gave
them the sensation of having to face defeat.</p>

<p>More furiously than ever did the Allies charge
them. They would not be denied the victory they
could now see looming up close at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>“Jack, they’re giving way, I do believe!”
shouted Amos.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the Turks?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Sure I do. You don’t think for a minute I
hope that those brave Australians would fall back
as long as one of them could stand. Yes, there
goes a bunch of the enemy. They bowled one of
those German officers off his feet when he tried
to stop them. I hope he’s captured, that’s what I
do. And, Jack, all along the line there’s a sign of
giving way. Hurrah! I really believe the game
is won!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, don’t shout too soon, Amos,” warned
the more cautious Jack, though for that matter
he himself had hard work to hold in. “They
may counter-attack, you know. When you
hear the Kangaroos yelling like mad you may
believe the victory is safe, but not yet, not
yet.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless hardly a minute more passed than
Jack himself was obliged to admit that it looked
as though others besides Amos believed the end
of the fierce engagement had come; for loud and<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
victorious whoops reached their ears from all
along the line.</p>

<p>These were echoed back by those who,
from one cause or another, had been kept in
camp, and not permitted to assist in cleaning
out the enemy trenches. Amos raised his strong
young voice, and gave numerous examples of
what he could do in the way of adding to the
din.</p>

<p>Outside of a football field after a close and exciting
game Jack believed he had never before
heard such a racket. The brave fellows up on the
hill, who had thrown the Turks out of their
trenches by bayonet thrusts, and close in-and-out
fighting, waved their hats, and let their lungs
have full play.</p>

<p>“Why, would you believe it, Jack!” cried Amos,
when he finally stopped his loud cheering and
became rational again, “I can see many of the
wounded fellows on the ground trying to wave
their hats, and I guess they’re yelling too. But
not all of the down-and-outs are doing it, I’m
sorry to say. Lots of them lie there as still as<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
anything; and I’m afraid the taking of the
trenches has cost a stiff price.”</p>

<p>Jack sighed.</p>

<p>“That’s always the case, Amos,” he went on to
say. “You must be willing to pay the toll if
you want anything worth while. And the better
the prize is the greater the price. When those
chaps from Australia want anything they will
never stop till they get it, as long as there are any
of them left.”</p>

<p>It could now be seen that those above were not
stopping to rejoice over their victory. They knew
the Turks were likely to come back as soon as
they could meet with reinforcements, and some
other German officers again took charge.</p>

<p>The rapid-fire guns that had been captured
with the trenches were immediately turned, and
placed so as to pour a hail of missiles on their
late owners should the battle be renewed. Others
of the same species were to be seen being taken
up the hill, having been kept somewhere below
in order to cover the retreat in case such a catastrophe
befell the Allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>“It was all splendidly planned, Jack,” said
Amos. “I give the Colonel credit for having a
long head. Still, the result might not have come
just as easily as it did were it not for Frank&mdash;well,
whoever the brave pilot of that aeroplane
may turn out to be.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did help a whole lot,” admitted
Jack. “Let’s hope he proves to be your brother;
also that he settles down on Gallipoli tonight instead
of flying across to that Greek island
where the rest of the pilots have their headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess he will stick here,” Amos hastened
to say, as though the wish were father to the
thought. “Especially after he’s been able to do
such great stunts for the Kangaroos.”</p>

<p>“I suppose now they will be pushing their line
further, if they can only hold those trenches up
on the hill,” Jack suggested.</p>

<p>“And so this is going to be the way the peninsula
will be won in the end, if it ever is won?”
Amos questioned, as though he found it hard
work to believe all those massive battleships, capable<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
of throwing tons and tons of mighty shells,
were unable to force a passage through the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>“That has to be left to the future to decide,”
Jack told him. “There’s a big ‘if’ connected with
everything undertaken these days. You can’t tell
what a week will bring on, with these Balkan
States hanging in the balance. If they could only
settle their differences, and join the Allies, it
would mean the beginning of the end.”</p>

<p>“Someone is calling to us, Jack, and I believe
they mean that lunch is all ready to serve. Come
to think of it, I’m really hungry! Suppose we
walk over and sit down. I wonder how those
tired chaps up there will get anything to eat.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of something else, Amos,” ventured
the other, seriously. “We must get through
with our bite as soon as we can for it strikes me
two husky fellows like ourselves ought to make
themselves useful as well as ornamental in such a
crisis as this.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean we can help carry some of the
wounded down where they can be looked after in<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
the temporary field hospital?” asked Amos, showing
decided interest in the matter.</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it,” Jack told him.</p>

<p>The guess Amos made concerning the meaning
of the call turned out to be correct. Evidently
the Colonel had left strict instructions looking to
the comfort of his young guests while he was
away, and the cook had not forgotten them.</p>

<p>Both of the boys pitched in with avidity. The
food was good, and they had not lost their appetites
in spite of all the sensations that had come
so near overwhelming them during the course of
the last hour.</p>

<p>They wasted no time in useless conversation,
for both boys realized that with so much suffering
on the slope above they ought to be doing what
they could to assist those who had been so kind.</p>

<p>No sooner was the hurried meal finished than
they started off. No one questioned or ventured
to detain them; in fact every man seemed to be
as busy as the proverbial bee about that time.
The boys met processions coming down the hill
bearing the wounded on stretchers, some of them<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
improvised since the force had managed to effect
a landing on the hostile shore.</p>

<p>Most of these poor fellows were bearing up
bravely; they even tried to wave a hand when
they met any comrade, and through the blood
marks of their pale faces a wan, forced smile
would appear, as though the indomitable nature
refused to cringe even when death was so very
near. Others, more desperately hurt, groaned
dismally, though perhaps they did not themselves
know it.</p>

<p>Finding a stretcher that had not been taken,
Jack and his chum pushed resolutely on up the
hill. There was danger that at any moment the
Turks, returning, might let loose a rain of fire
from new positions; but even this possibility
failed to deter the two American boys when they
saw their duty before them.</p>

<p>When a short time later they arrived at the
scene of the dreadful carnage their hearts felt sick
within them, for after all they were only boys,
and not accustomed to such dreadful surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, if their faces did seem white,
their teeth were grimly set, and it was evident
they did not mean to allow any squeamishness to
prevent them from accomplishing the Samaritan
work they had set out to perform.</p>

<p>“Here’s a poor fellow waiting to be looked
after,” said Amos, as they glanced about them for
some moving figure whom they could assist.</p>

<p>The soldier was badly hurt in the leg. He had
managed to tie his red bandana handkerchief
tightly around the limb to prevent his bleeding
to death. Evidently he must have refused to let
them carry him down to the hospital when others
were in greater need of surgical attendance than
he.</p>

<p>The boys heard him start to say something to
that effect as they came up. Jack, however, saw
that the man was really growing weak, and was
carrying his splendid self denial to an extreme
point that might bring about his collapse.</p>

<p>“We’re going to carry you down, my friend,
no matter what you say,” he told the gallant Kangaroo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly they placed him on the litter as
easily as possible, and after that started down the
slope. <a id="Ref_233"></a>On the way, whom should they meet but
the Colonel himself! He must have been in the
thick of the battle for he had one arm tied up,
and his uniform showed several rents as though
made by vicious bayonet thrusts. At sight of the
two American boys and their burden the doughty
officer smiled affably.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">On the way, whom should they meet but the Colonel
himself!&mdash;<em><a href="#Ref_233">Page 233</a></em></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Good for you, my boys!” he exclaimed. “It is
a pleasure to be entertaining guests who believe
in lending a helping hand. We need all the assistance
we can get, for we paid a terrible price to
gain the victory. But the trenches are ours, and
all the Turks and Germans on Gallipoli never can
throw us out of them again. I will see you before
night comes; there is too much to be looked after
just now to give a thought to your affairs. Thank
you again a thousand times, boys!”</p>

<p>He hurried away up the hill, evidently to look
after the placing of his men, as well as the quick-firers
upon which they must depend to repel any
new assault on the part of the furious enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>When the boys reached the field hospital, which
had been established under the bluff where no
Turkish guns could drop missiles upon the
wounded despite the Red Cross flag, they found
it a busy place indeed. Scores of injured had
already been brought in, and the few surgeons
with their assistants were hurrying from one case
to another. They themselves would be ready to
drop when the last patient had received proper
attention.</p>

<p>The boys did not linger, it may be taken for
granted. They had no desire to look upon the
accumulated suffering to be found there under
the bluff on that warm day. No doubt as long
as the sun remained above the horizon plenty of
work would be found for those who were not
needed to man the advanced line. Even after all
the injured had been taken care of the dead must
be buried, both friend and foe alike, for the protection
of the living.</p>

<p>After wandering around for a short time
above, and not seeming to find a wounded Territorial,
Jack ventured to make a proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

<p>“Here’s a poor Turk who seems to be in a bad
way,” he said. “I’m going to give him a drink
of cold water, and then we’ll get him on our
stretcher.”</p>

<p>Amos looked curiously at his chum, but almost
immediately cried:</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Jack; they can feel their
injuries just as much as the rest. It was only
proper that the boys should take care of their
own first; but depend on it they’ve got too big
hearts to let any enemy lie here in this hot sun
and want for a drink of water. There, you can
see they are carrying a Turk down on that
stretcher.”</p>

<p>Just then Jack gave vent to a cry that betokened
some new thrill, and Amos turned quickly to see
if the enemy had come in sight again, bent on a
fresh attack.</p>

<p>“Do you see that dead man lying there on his
face, Amos?” Jack demanded, pointing as he
spoke. “Look closer and you’ll see he is no Turk
but one of those arbitrary German officers we saw
trying to force the men to fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>“I see what you mean, Jack. He didn’t die
from a Territorial’s blow. There is a bayonet
through his body, a Turkish sword bayonet, and
it came from behind him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack with a shudder, “one of the
Turks he may have struck with the flat of his
sword repaid the blow. But let us go on and
get this man down to the emergency hospital.
Then we will come up again, for there are many
more Turkish wounded needing attention.”</p>

<p>So they worked diligently on, plodding back
and forth, and during that warm afternoon many
a feverish Turk called down the blessings of Allah
upon the heads of the two friendly American boys
who gave him cold water to freshen his parched
throat, and then bore him to where his injuries
might be attended to.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">STARTING ON A DANGEROUS TRIP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The long day came to an end at last. None of
those who had taken part in or even witnessed the
glorious taking of the Turkish trenches would
ever be likely to forget the experience.</p>

<p>All the wounded had been carried to the temporary
hospital. If a vessel could be summoned
by wireless they were to be removed to some
other place, where they might be nursed, and
brought back to health without constant danger
of being under fire.</p>

<p>Many of the dead had also been buried. The
work in this respect, proving too stupendous a
task for one day, had to be dropped for another
time. Besides, it was really of greater importance
that the safety of the living be looked after
than the disposal of those who were out of the
fight for good.</p>

<p>The boys had done all they could to lend a helping<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
hand. On every side they received words of
gratitude and praise. It heartened those valiant
fellows from the antipodes to find American boys
standing by them in this emergency. Small although
the circumstance might seem to them, it
meant much, for they chose to feel that they had
the moral backing of the vast majority of Americans
in their struggle against the military ideas
formulated by the Teuton ruling families.</p>

<p>And now the sun was setting. It went down
like a great glowing ball of fire, as though in
keeping with the terrible work of the day. It
somehow made Jack think of an interesting story
he had read in a paper, concerning a famous battlefield
where thousands had fallen, and telling
how, in the following year, the ground was a
mass of fire as innumerable red poppies bloomed.
The superstitious peasants declared that the
earth had refused to hold all the blood with which
it had been drenched on that awful day.</p>

<p>Although both Jack and Amos felt somewhat
tired after so strenuous an afternoon, at the same
time this was not going to deter them from trying<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
to reach the camp of the New Zealand troops
further up the shore by a mile and more.</p>

<p>The Colonel had given them his promise, and
they believed he was one who always kept his
word, no matter how much he might regret it.
They had seen him at intervals during the rest of
the afternoon, but never to talk to, for he was
always hurrying this way and that, personally
seeing that the newly acquired trenches were being
put in a state of defense so that no matter
how fiercely the Turks attacked they would be
beaten back.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” ventured Amos, as they watched
the big orb dip lower and lower until its rim was
hidden beneath the watery horizon that lay in
the far west, “I wonder now if I’ll be with Frank
when the sun peeks up again tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be a pretty good chance that
way, I’m ready to admit,” Jack told him. “In
fact, it strikes me we must by this time be pretty
near the end of the long trail. First we missed
connections with him in Belgium; then came that
chase through the French war trenches; and at<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
last the trip to the Dardanelles. Believe me,
you’re going to lay hands on Frank this time, anyway,
Amos. You need something like that to put
new heart in you.”</p>

<p>“Well, as a rule I’m not so easily discouraged,
Jack, and you know it; but again and again I’ve
been cheated out of even getting a glimpse of my
brother, and it wears on a fellow, you see.”</p>

<p>“Change the subject, and you’ll feel better,”
his chum advised. “For instance, do you think
you could eat any supper? It looks to me as if
we would soon be called to join the Colonel and
two of his officers yonder.”</p>

<p>“Evidently he means to keep Headquarters
down here yet a while,” speculated Amos.</p>

<p>“Well, as yet they’re not so sure they can hold
the advanced line. They fully expect to be attacked
between now and morning, when there’ll
be some more terrible work going on; only this
time it must be up to the Turks to do the attacking.”</p>

<p>“Then, you mark my words for it, they’ll suffer
an awful loss, Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>“I agree with you,” said the other quickly.
“Like the Germans, they believe in massed formations
when making assaults. In these modern
days of quick-firers that is a risky thing to do.
It may carry everything before it like a football
rush does, but at a frightful cost.”</p>

<p>Presently the call to supper reached the boys in
the shape of a message from the Colonel. He
greeted both with a pleasant smile, and asked that
they make themselves at home at the rude camp
table where his meals were served.</p>

<p>The conversation for a while ran upon the stirring
events of the day, and the listening boys
learned how the plan of campaign had been rigidly
adhered to from beginning to end. Evidently the
Colonel fully believed victory would have been
their portion even though the daring air pilot
had refrained from attacking the enemy with
his bombs, and creating the first decided feeling of
apprehension among the enemy. At the same
time he frankly acknowledged the material assistance
his men had received from this work on the
part of the aeroplane man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>“If he was your brother, Amos, give him my
compliments when you meet him, and thank him
heartily for my Territorial tigers. He helped us
not a little by scattering the enemy at just that
critical moment. His work was as dashing as
anything I ever struck; and it’s plain to be
seen such a birdman is a brother to be proud
of.”</p>

<p>Those were pleasant words to Amos. They
seemed to repay him for all he had gone through
with on that awful day. Frank was his brother,
and he would much sooner hear him praised than
listen to any amount of commendation for
himself.</p>

<p>It was not until after the two officers had left
the table to hurry to their positions so as to be in
the harness for the night that the Colonel referred
in the least degree to the contemplated expedition
of the two American lads.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have made all your arrangements
with Arturus before now, boys,” the
Colonel remarked presently.</p>

<p>Jack explained to him what they had done, and<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
after hearing all about it the Colonel shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I’m more than half sorry now I promised to
let you make the attempt,” he told them. “The
dangers will be multiplied after the defeat the
Turks have suffered today. They come down in
places to the very shore, and you are apt to run
upon some of them at any time. I’m afraid they
will be feeling unusually ugly after the way my
boys handled them.”</p>

<p>“But there seems to be no other way for me
to get to the upper camp, Colonel,” remarked
Amos eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say there isn’t at present, since
we have no boat; and I understand just how
anxious you must be to learn the truth. So I suppose
I’ll have to salve my conscience by saying
there’s no help for it. But I sincerely hope nothing
may befall you on the road.”</p>

<p>The heartiness of his words, as well as his manner,
convinced Jack that the Colonel felt more
than a passing interest in their welfare. Perhaps
the fact that Jack seemed to remind him of<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
his own son, thousands of miles away from there,
had more or less to do with that circumstance,
though not everything.</p>

<p>They continued to chat as they sat there. When
Jack began to see that the mind of their host was
evidently turning toward his own affairs, of
which he had enough to worry over, to be sure,
he concluded that it might be well for himself
and Amos to say good-bye.</p>

<p>“Here’s wishing you every good thing that your
hearts long for,” said the Colonel, as he squeezed
their hands at parting. “I hope you find your
brother, Frank, and take him home with you to
that old father who longs so to see him once
more. I also deplore the necessity for his going,
because he will be sorely missed here where every
good man is needed.”</p>

<p>The boys would often think of the valiant
Colonel. Should they return in safety to their
native shores he had given them his home address
where they could, if they chose, learn what his
fate turned out to be. He spoke of the uncertain
future with the grim look of a brave man, and<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
said the chances were his life would have to be
laid down, like countless others, for the cause they
fought to win.</p>

<p>Jack had already glimpsed the young Greek,
Arturus, who seemed to be hovering near by as
though waiting for them to leave the hospitable
board of the commanding officer. Presently they
were joined by the intended guide. Jack, looking
him over again, saw no reason to alter the
former good opinion he had held of Arturus. He
would prove loyal through everything, and they
could place the utmost reliance on his honesty as
well as his courage.</p>

<p>“It is yet too soon to start,” he told them;
“much safer that we wait until another hour has
passed. Then it may be we will stand a better
chance of passing through without meeting any
Turks who have come down near the water for
some purpose.”</p>

<p>Accordingly they all sat down and talked. Jack
was not sorry of a chance to pick up some information
concerning the route the Greek expected
to take them over. Besides, he believed<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
that, with a little encouragement, Arturus might
tell them about some of the desperate undertakings
in which, with Captain Zenos, he had been
engaged in times past.</p>

<p>So the minutes glided on until finally the Greek
announced it was time for them to be moving.
The boys were soon ready, and the three of them
glided out of the camp, no one offering the least
objection, for the sentries had all been informed
about their contemplated perilous trip to the upper
camp.</p>

<p>Up to the time of their departure no sound
from above proclaimed that the Turks in augmented
numbers had come back to try and recover
their lost trenches.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_247" class="pagenum">[247]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE HIDDEN BATTERY ON THE SHORE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Talking was not to be encouraged during this
secret night trip up along the strip of coast
stretching between the camps of the Australian
and the New Zealand contingents of the fighting
Territorials. If there arose any necessity for
exchanging remarks, great care was to be taken
to whisper in the lowest tone possible.</p>

<p>Arturus, the Greek guide, had told the boys
there was every likelihood of their meeting detachments
of the Turks somewhere on the way.
The enemy moved about more or less, seeking
new positions which they believed would be to
their advantage. More than this, they were very
fond of night attacks, and would go to great
trouble to surprise the entrenched invaders.</p>

<p>On this account, then, the boys had made up
their minds to be surprised at nothing. They
hoped to get through in safety, and would do<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
everything in their power to bring about such a
desirable result.</p>

<p>Several things favored them, they had figured.
In the first place the night was rather dark,
though when their eyes became accustomed to
their surroundings they were able to see fairly
well. Then there was the fact that both boys
were good at this sort of thing, being well up in
most of the rules of woodcraft; so that they were
not apt to stumble clumsily along, and constantly
threaten to betray their presence to any lurking
foe.</p>

<p>Best of all, Jack considered, was the fact that
they had engaged the services of a skillful guide
in the person of Arturus. He knew every foot
of the ground, for most of his life had been spent
on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Consequently they
would have the advantage of being led around
certain gullies that might have proved barriers or
traps to anyone unacquainted with the vicinity.</p>

<p>Jack had amused himself during the afternoon
in seeking a position that was a little elevated,
where he could get something of a view of the<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
territory beyond. Here, with the aid of his
binoculars, he had tried to figure out what might
be the easiest way of advancing.</p>

<p>When, soon after they had departed from the
camp, he found that the guide was beginning to
turn toward the edge of the water, Jack was not
much surprised. Indeed, he had wondered why
this might not prove the easiest method of covering
the space separating the two camps.</p>

<p>Upon mentioning his belief to Arturus, Jack
had learned that part of the trail did lead along
the sandy stretch that hugged the shore. The
only trouble was that some of the Turks were in
the habit of coming down to the water during the
night, and this being the case they were likely
to stumble upon the enemy at any minute.</p>

<p>A sharp lookout was necessary to prevent discovery.
No matter how lonely their surroundings
might seem they must not be off their guard.
Amos had been duly impressed with the fact that
silence was golden in this case, and all comments
he might feel inclined to make would have to be
left until another time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>Presently they could hear the sound of the
waves running up on the sandy beach. It chanced
to be an unusually quiet night. Even out on the
deep water there seemed to be nothing doing,
though far away the boys could catch the flitting
gleam of searchlights playing at tag with the
darkness, as the vessels of the fleet stood guard.</p>

<p>Had the wind chosen to rise and rattle the
leaves of the stumpy trees, as well as dash the
rollers against the shore with more or less of a
resounding clamor, it would have served their
purpose much better. Still, they had to take conditions
as they found them, and make the best of
it.</p>

<p>Every rod placed behind them counted. Arturus
had assured them it was not more than a
mile and a half at the most which they had to
cover before reaching the vicinity of the other
camp.</p>

<p>Now a distance like that may seem a mere
trifle when the road is good, and the traveler has
daylight to show him what obstacles he must surmount.
When he finds it necessary to grope his<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
way along over the roughest of ground, avoiding
many threatening pitfalls, listening constantly
for signs of lurking foes, and meeting with every
conceivable manner of trouble, the case becomes
a more serious one.</p>

<p>Amos had started with a light heart. He fancied
they would certainly be able to tide over the
gap inside of an hour or two. Looking back he
could remember several instances when he and
Jack had done such a caper as this without exerting
themselves unduly. He therefore felt that
before the end came they would surprise the guide
with the abundance of their knowledge concerning
Indian ways. Darkness had little terror for
Amos at starting time.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far, however, when he
began to realize that he was up against a pretty
hard proposition, a much tougher one than he
had imagined could confront them.</p>

<p>There seemed to be some sort of rough road
along the shore. It could not have been much of
a thoroughfare in its palmiest days, and long
neglect had caused it to become a hollow mockery,<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
had one attempted to drive any sort of vehicle
that way.</p>

<p>For a short time after leaving the camp Arturus
had been leading them along this road.
Now he dropped down and sought the shallow
beach, and Jack guessed that the going would be
better there.</p>

<p>In this he found himself correct, though they
had to keep close to the little bluff, and stop to
listen every minute or so for signs of hostile
forces ahead.</p>

<p>Amos was trying to figure out what distance
they had covered. The only way he knew of
accomplishing this was according to the steps
they took. He had worked that all out, knew the
number of feet in a mile, and counting two to a
step believed he could tell when they had passed
the half-way mark.</p>

<p>When, according to his deductions, they had
actually made one-third of the distance, his hopes
began to mount higher. Why, after all, this was
not so very bad; he felt positive they could get to
their destination in due course of time; and thinking<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
thus Amos was actually patting himself&mdash;figuratively
of course&mdash;upon his back.</p>

<p>Then something happened as usual to throw
down all these fine castles in the air. Arturus
came to a sudden pause. He held out both hands
as though to prevent either of his charges from
advancing another step.</p>

<p>Standing or half crouching there they strained
their ears to listen. Low sounds reached them as
the night air took a new slant just then, striking
directly in their faces.</p>

<p>There was the mutter of voices for one thing,
and then came a queer clinking noise, followed by
more grumbling sounds. Jack jumped to the conclusion
that they must have stumbled upon a nest
of the enemy, who for some reason had taken up
a position at this particular spot where the scrub
grew thickest, and they could more easily lie in
ambush.</p>

<p>The boy wondered what reason the Turks could
have for hiding here; and what that strange clinking
sound meant. Possibly Arturus, who was
better acquainted with such things, would be able<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
to understand it all. He had hardly come to this
conclusion when he felt the Greek guide pushing
him gently back. This Jack knew meant they
must retreat for a consultation; and taking hold
of his chum’s arm, he commenced a retrograde
movement.</p>

<p>Amos did not like it. He evidently feared the
Greek guide had been seized with what might be
termed in boy’s parlance, “cold feet,” and meant
to give up the undertaking. That showed how
poorly Amos had sized up the young Greek; Jack
knew better, and was perfectly willing to continue
to trust the pilot of the secret expedition to the
end.</p>

<p>When they had gone back a little way Arturus
bade them halt, and in a low whisper started to
explain what it all meant.</p>

<p>“It appears that the Turks have brought one
of their biggest guns down to the shore here since
I was over the trail last,” he told them. “It is a
battery hidden in the rocks and brush. Some time
they hope that a warship it come close to the shore
in the daytime. Then a shot from the big gun<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
sink her easy. So they hide here, and wait their
time.”</p>

<p>“But does that spoil our trip, Arturus?” asked
Amos fretfully.</p>

<p>“Not at all. We must only go around instead
of following the beach, or the old trail. It takes
us longer, to be sure, but after all what is time
when we have the rest of the night before us?
You come along with me, and I show you how it
can be done.”</p>

<p>Of course this intelligence pleased Amos immensely.
His heart grew light again. After all
it was going to be only one of those little troubles
which they must surmount before they could hope
to attain their cherished end. The more they had
to battle with these impediments the sweeter victory
would be finally.</p>

<p>They accordingly climbed up the little bluff,
taking care not to make too much noise, though
Arturus did not seem to believe the Turks manning
the hidden big gun battery could be very
watchful.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this part of their task,<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
the guide led them further back from the shore
line. It was fearfully rough. At times they were
almost compelled to get down on their hands and
knees in order to make progress; but in spite of
all this they persisted diligently, and in the end
reached what Arturus must have considered a
reasonably safe distance from the battery.</p>

<p>Here he changed his course, and once more
headed up the shore, intending thus to make a
half circuit, so as to come out upon the neglected
road above the enemy’s position.</p>

<p>By this time Amos had changed his mind not
a little. He figured that when everything was
considered this night’s adventure would take its
place among his most difficult feats. Truth to
tell, he could not remember the time when he had
undergone such a strenuous “crawl” as this was
turning out to be. His hands were scratched by
thorns and sharp-pointed rocks, while his knees
threatened to be placed in the same category. In
spite of it all, Amos did not venture to complain&mdash;he
only shut his teeth tightly together, and mentally
vowed to keep up the fight until he dropped;<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
for he believed the goal to be near at hand now,
and victory was worth all that he suffered and
even more.</p>

<p>After a long siege of it the boys noticed that
again their course was changed. This seemed
to tell them they must have passed the battery in
the brush and detached rocks, so that it would
be safe to edge their way down to where the going
would be somewhat better.</p>

<p>Once they arrived at that long disused road,
it was to be hoped they might continue along
it to the end, for it would likely fetch them to
the camp which the New Zealand troops had succeeded
in making above. This they knew was
close to the water’s edge, for thus far it had not
been possible to improve the position the Territorials
had seized on first landing.</p>

<p>Finally they struck the old road, and Amos
mentally shook hands with himself as he figured
on easier progress. This certainly was a night
long to be remembered. He wondered if there
could be any other queer experience awaiting
them before the goal was attained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>Hardly had Amos allowed himself to think
along these lines when there came a sudden glare
of white light. It was as though a dozen full
moons had been uncovered from dense clouds
overhead, sending their concentrated rays down
upon the lonely shore of Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Looking up in a startled way they could see a
moving object faintly outlined against the star-studded
heavens. A constantly increasing shaft
of dazzling light poured down from this hovering
object, and seemed to center upon a spot just a
little way in their rear.</p>

<p>Jack guessed what it meant almost instantly.
He realized that it must be some kind of aeroplane
carrying a searchlight, though he had not
known of such a thing before. Swiftly Jack figured
out the rest of it. During the day just
passed, while soaring over the peninsula before
or after the battle for the trenches, this air-pilot
must have discovered the hidden battery in spite
of the care the Turks had taken to conceal the big
gun.</p>

<p>No doubt the necessary information had<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
been sent to the commander of the fleet who
could arrange plans looking to the smashing
of the battery while darkness lay upon land and
sea.</p>

<p>Out there a mile or two, doubtless, a battleship
was ready to open fire at the proper time. The
aeroplane hovering above was signaling to show
just where the battery lay. Imagine the sudden
fright of those Turkish gunners when that astonishing
glow so suddenly fell around them, and
remained stationary.</p>

<p>Before Jack could open his lips to mention
what had flashed through his active mind there
came a flash and a dreadful boom far out at sea.
The unseen war vessel had discharged one of her
guns, having the exact range, and being guided by
the friendly light from above.</p>

<p>Amos involuntarily dropped down flat on the
ground, in which action he was immediately
copied by the two others. They were none too
soon, for the earth fairly quaked under the
mighty explosion that followed. The shell had
burst very close by, and Jack was of the opinion<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
that the estimations of the British gunner must
have been remarkably accurate.</p>

<p>If the Turkish battery had managed to escape
that first explosion there would very likely be
more coming along. The intense white light
from above continued to cover the spot in a most
tantalizing way; and there was no means for
shutting it off. The guide called out just
then:</p>

<p>“Come, we must make off as fast as we can
before another shell falls. This time it may be
closer to us, and we may be torn to pieces.
Hasten, everyone. Do not mind little things like
that,” he added, as Amos in his extreme haste fell
over some obstacle, and measured his length on
the rough ground.</p>

<p>They had not gone much more than forty feet
when again came that flash out at sea. Once
more they threw themselves flat in hopes of being
able to escape the flying missiles better when
in this recumbent position. The dreadful explosion
was as awe-inspiring as the first had been;
and Jack noticed that if anything this shell landed<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
closer to where that big Turkish gun had been
hidden from sight, with the intention of some
day surprising an incautious vessel of the Allied
fleet.</p>

<span id="Page_262" class="pagenum">[262]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PERILS OF THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“That must have done some damage, I reckon!”
gasped Amos as he struggled once more to
his feet, ready to push steadily on again.</p>

<p>They had heard a series of shouts, some of
them indicating pain, and others an acute degree
of terror. Evidently the Turkish gunners were
being demoralized by this firing. The bursting
shells were working sad havoc in their midst.</p>

<p>But Turks have ever been known to show
bravery under fire, and Jack was not so very
much surprised when there came a bellow from
the rear that made the earth quiver. The big
gun hidden in the brush and rocky spurs had
been fired, perhaps almost at random, to prove
to the enemy that although betrayed by that
searchlight from above the gunners were ready
to die at their posts.</p>

<p>The two boys and Arturus were all hurrying<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
along by that time, eager to put as much space
between themselves and the danger zone as possible.
More terrible shells were bound to fall
in that limited area, and since the Turks would
be utterly unable to move their big gun it stood a
good show of being finally smashed.</p>

<p>So accurately did the gunners on the warship
manage to drop their missiles that there seemed
no further danger of one falling close enough to
the boys to injure them. On this account then
they no longer threw themselves down when that
flash over the water announced the speeding of
another projectile.</p>

<p>Amos, being now filled with a natural curiosity
to observe the effect of the bursting shells, actually
turned his head to look back when the next
shot came. He would never forget the dreadful
sight when the great shell exploded. The whole
vicinity seemed to be illuminated by the glare,
and Amos believed he could see unfortunate men
being hurled right and left, as well as logs and
stones.</p>

<p>“Oh! that was the time they hit it!” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
when the fearful thunder of the explosion
had died away.</p>

<p>“Do you mean they smashed the big gun?”
asked Jack, who apparently had not been looking
at the time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure of it,” the other went on to assert;
“for I saw the shell burst, it seemed to
me, right against the cannon. You’ll hear no
more from that piece, I give you my affidavy,
Jack. It was beautifully done, and I take off
my hat to the bullies out there in the gloom who
could find their mark so quickly.”</p>

<p>“But the searchlight keeps on playing down on
the spot,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“They’re trying to make sure of the result,”
Amos declared. “You’ll soon see I was right
about it, when they send a signal out to the battleship
that there’s no need to waste any more
ammunition.”</p>

<p>Somehow they were so fascinated by the idea
that all of them stood there, and continued to
watch. The air pilot even swooped down lower
as though bent upon making absolutely sure before<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
sending word to the war vessel waiting to
hear from him before continuing the bombardment.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you?” exclaimed Amos,
with a ring of triumph in his voice.</p>

<p>The aviator above had suddenly switched off
his light, and dense darkness fell upon the scene.
No further crash from off over the water came
to the ears of the listening boys. The only sounds
they heard consisted of cries from wounded men,
and a faint faraway whir that must be the aeroplane
winging its way back to its former post.</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” said Jack, almost solemnly;
“another gun knocked out of business, and from
what they say, the Turks can’t afford to lose
many more these days, when it’s so hard to get
them through from Austria and Germany.”</p>

<p>“We must go on,” said Arturus just then, “for
we may be overtaken by some of the Turks fleeing
from the place.”</p>

<p>“But did you notice, Jack, that the aeroplane
seemed to fly away <em>up</em> the coast and not out to
sea?” ventured Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[266]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now, I hadn’t thought anything about
that until you spoke; but now you have mentioned
it, Amos, I believe that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Of course we couldn’t see anything,” continued
the other, “but I took great pains to follow
the sound, and it kept right along ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“From that you figure something out, of
course?” asked the other. “I can give a pretty
good guess what it is.”</p>

<p>“That aviator must have been the same man
who hung over the trenches today, and dropped
so many bombs,” Amos ventured. “We know he
came from the upper camp; and I feel dead sure
he was my brother Frank. If that’s so, then
here he’s gone and distinguished himself again.”</p>

<p>“It certainly looks as if Frank might be in the
front rank of the Allied pilots if it turns out as
we believe,” Jack permitted himself to say; “but
now we’d better quiet down again, Amos. Arturus
doesn’t like to have us chattering away like
this, even if it is in whispers.”</p>

<p>“Because we are not yet out of the bushes,”
added the Greek guide suggestively, by which<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
they understood him to mean that with half the
distance still to be covered there always existed a
possibility that other enemies might be encountered.</p>

<p>Jack, as he walked along in the wake of Arturus,
was thinking very naturally of what wonderful
things this war had already brought forth,
what with its Zeppelins, the submarine raiders
which Germany was letting loose to prey upon
the fleets and commerce of her enemies; the marvelous
big guns which were able to smash the
most formidable steel defences known to modern
military science; and the amazing trenches
made of concrete which existed for hundreds of
miles along the fighting line in Northern France
and Belgium.</p>

<p>He wondered what would be the next marvel
brought out by one side or the other. At that
time the asphyxiating gases of the Germans, and
the dreadful liquid fire had not been used; but
Jack could easily anticipate something along these
lines.</p>

<p>As for the aeroplane, it had proved its wonderful<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
strategic value a thousand times over. Its
uses were manifold, from scouting to dropping
bombs in daylight raids over enemy country and
barracks. Jack had already seen enough of these
things to convince him that the country which
had an abundant supply of both submarines and
giant aeroplanes could carry things their own
way in the future.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Arturus all of a sudden.</p>

<p>“We are being pursued!” whispered Amos, as
he plainly heard voices from the rear, accompanied
by other sounds that might spring from
men stumbling while hurrying madly along the
rough trail.</p>

<p>The Greek drew his charges aside, and crouching
amidst the bushes, they waited to ascertain
what it could all mean. Closer came the sounds.
They could now make out that the men rushing
headlong toward them were Turks. Jack wondered
if they could really be hunting the three
who had passed around the hidden battery just
before it was bombarded so successfully from
out at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[269]</span></p>

<p>Moving figures now caught their attention,
three of them, and all stumbling along in the most
reckless fashion. From their excited manner
Jack immediately made up his mind they must
be remnants of the force of gunners who had had
charge of the battery. Wounded by some of the
flying missiles when the shells burst around them,
they had fled in a panic, that kept them pushing
on even after the danger seemed past.</p>

<p>They shuffled by the spot where the boys were
concealed, and went on up the shore. Jack’s first
thought was that this was a peculiar thing for
them to do, since they must certainly know that
the camp of the New Zealand troops lay not so
very far away in that direction.</p>

<p>“What do you make out of it, Arturus?” he
asked, softly.</p>

<p>“They belonged to the battery, and have been
badly frightened,” the guide replied. “I have
not before seen Turks show such alarm. It must
be what you call the panic has gripped hold of
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can understand all that,” continued<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
Jack, “but why should they keep on up the shore?
A safe retreat for them would be to take to the
hills.”</p>

<p>“That is something we do not know,” answered
the guide, seriously, “but it may be we will soon
find out. It was no accident, that is sure; and I
believe there may be other Turkish forces between
us and the camp.”</p>

<p>“Whew! again?” muttered Amos, thinking of
that terrible climb they had been forced to take
in order to pass around the concealed battery.</p>

<p>The sound of the fleeing Turks had now subsided.
Either they had passed beyond hearing or
else managed in some way to curb their panicky
condition. At the very least it meant they would
have these three enemies to contend against, and
must therefore be constantly on their guard.</p>

<p>If anything, the ground grew rougher than before.
Amos believed so since he tripped more
frequently, though that may have come from his
weariness. It had been an exhausting day for
the boys, what with their work as Red Cross
stretcher-bearers, and a lot of other duties performed<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
by them. Any boy might well have confessed
that he was almost worn out from fatigue;
and it was the wild hope of meeting his missing
brother Frank that kept Amos up, more than his
will power.</p>

<p>They had not been moving along for more than
ten minutes in this slow and cautious fashion
when again Arturus, the Greek, came to a stand.
Instinctively both of the boys immediately
strained their hearing to ascertain what sounds
may have reached the ears of the guide. And
what they managed to catch gave them to understand
that a large body of the enemy must be
straddling the trail ahead, for some purpose or
other.</p>

<span id="Page_272" class="pagenum">[272]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WITH THE NEW ZEALAND CONTINGENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Wait here until I return!”</p>

<p>The Greek guide whispered these words in
Jack’s ear, thus recognizing the fact that he knew
which of the two boys could be accounted the
leader.</p>

<p>Without explaining what he meant to do he
left them, and his form was speedily swallowed
up in the gloom. Amos hardly knew what it
meant, though, of course, knowing that Arturus
had not basely deserted them thus.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Jack?” he asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>“He believes there is a large body of Turks
on the road ahead, and has gone to find out,”
Jack told him after he had placed his lips close
to the other’s ear.</p>

<p>Amos only grunted. No doubt he was beginning
to believe there never could have been a more
difficult undertaking than the one they were now<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
engaged upon. Troubles seemed to be following
quick and fast on each other’s heels&mdash;first that
battery, then the task of passing around it, and
now something else.</p>

<p>Crouching there, they waited as patiently as
they could for Arturus’ return. In the meantime
they listened, and could catch sounds that
told of many men being close by, a fact that
seemed to prove Jack’s conclusion sound. The
Turks must be gathering a force with the intention
of making a night attack on the little New
Zealand contingent beyond, expecting to take
them by surprise and sweep them into the sea.</p>

<p>He did not tell Amos this, not wanting to discourage
the other, who had already met with so
many disappointments. It stood to reason,
though, that if the “Kiwis” were dislodged, and
either captured, or forced to take to their boats,
the aviator must vacate his little field where he
had held forth, venturing on so many daring
trips.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged terribly. Every now and
then Amos would let fall a great big sigh, proving<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
how this delay was cutting him to the heart.
Surely Arturus must have had ample time by
now to find out all he wanted to know, and
should be back with his companions again.
But Jack refused to let himself suspect anything
like treachery on the part of the guide, whose
measure he had taken in the start, and in whom
he put the utmost trust.</p>

<p>Presently he was relieved to hear a slight sound
as of someone approaching. It came from the
proper direction, and he felt sure Arturus was
returning.</p>

<p>A figure could now be dimly made out; still
neither of the boys so much as moved a finger.
They were waiting for something more definite
to identify the other.</p>

<p>“Jack, Amos!”</p>

<p>When they heard their names breathed ever
so softly they knew it was all right, and that
Arturus had come back; so they immediately
hastened to join him.</p>

<p>“It is even worse than I believed,” was the
first thing he told them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>“They are Turks, of course?” asked Amos,
never forgetting for a moment the need of extreme
caution when making any communication.</p>

<p>“Yes, hundreds of them gathered there,” he
was told. “It is their intention to creep around
and attack the camp from the east. Already
many of them have started up among the rocks,
and the rest expect to follow.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we must manage some way or other to
warn the troops, or they may be caught napping,
and all of them killed,” Amos went on to say.</p>

<p>“What is the best plan of campaign, Arturus?”
asked Jack in his customary direct way; for he
knew that action alone could secure the end they
had in view.</p>

<p>“We can wait until all have left the road and
then pass on,” explained Arturus; “or if we please
we might reach the beach, and proceed that way.”</p>

<p>“They may happen to leave a few men behind
them to watch the road,” suggested Jack. “On
the whole, I think it our best plan to take to the
shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[276]</span></p>

<p>“Just as you say, and I myself believe that is
the safest way,” admitted Arturus.</p>

<p>“Then let’s be moving right away,” begged
Amos.</p>

<p>There was no objection to his plea, and consequently
they turned to the left, for the water lay
in that quarter. Once more they lowered themselves
down the little bluff, and if a few stones
were dislodged they expected that the sounds
would, even if heard by the nearby Turks, not
be deemed suspicious, or worthy of investigation.</p>

<p>Once they struck the sandy strip where the
little waves came running up close to their feet,
all of them felt vastly relieved. If only they
could creep past the danger spot, they would
very likely be on the home stretch, and could
reach their destination without further trouble.</p>

<p>The voices of the Turks reached them more
plainly as they pushed on. It meant that some
of them were squatting on the very bluff overhead;
so that if the trio expected to pass unobserved
they must continue to be exceedingly
careful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[277]</span></p>

<p>All Jack hoped for was that none of the Turks
would happen to be down by the edge of the
water. If that proved to be the case they would
be compelled to postpone their passage until the
last of the followers of Mahomet had withdrawn,
following the rest of the detachment up the hill.</p>

<p>Jack placed implicit confidence in Arturus, and
the Greek did not fail them. He kept as close
to the bluff as possible, while advancing all the
while; and quite naturally the two boys copied
his example, recognizing the value of it.</p>

<p>In this way they gradually managed to creep
past the spot where the Turks on the little bluff
above kept up their low-toned conversation. Possibly
Arturus understood what they said, but it
was useless for either of the others to try and
grasp the meaning, since the Turkish tongue was
a sealed book to them.</p>

<p>When this had been accomplished, and they
could feel that they were safely by, both boys felt
pleased. A heavy load was taken from the chest
of Amos, so that once again he could encourage
himself with fresh hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>Their progress was now more speedy, though
Arturus still kept on his guard. Jack admired
the fellow more and more as he saw him work.
He felt sure Arturus must be a born scout, and
in the service of the Allies ashore on Gallipoli
would prove himself to be a valuable man indeed.</p>

<p>From this time onward all of them were keenly
on the watch for some sign ahead to indicate the
presence of the Territorials. They did not mean
to take any chance of being shot at by some
vigilant sentry, who may have discovered their
coming from his post in the darkness, and mistaken
them for a straggling party of the enemy.</p>

<p>As it was no longer possible to advance any
further along the beach, owing to their having
reached a place where the waves ran up against
the rocks direct, the guide had once more led
them to the forsaken shore road, and they were
now moving along that.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Jack sniffed the air.
He had caught a whiff of tobacco smoke, it
seemed to him. Possibly one of the sentries had<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
managed in some way to roll a cigarette, and was
enjoying a few puffs, hiding the light as well as
he could with his hands.</p>

<p>Arturus, too, must have caught the same odor
for he had come to a pause; and all of them
seemed to be trying to pierce the black curtain
ahead in hopes of picking up a tiny speck of fire
that would betray the presence of the soldier.
After all, it was Amos whose sharp eyes discovered
what they sought. He gripped Jack’s arm
and pointed, although it was difficult to follow
his extended hand.</p>

<p>Jack, however, saw a tiny glow. The night
air, too, came from that very quarter, showing
how the odor of tobacco smoke had been carried
to them.</p>

<p>“Lie low in case he fires at us, and let me
challenge him,” he told the others.</p>

<p>His voice must have faintly reached the unseen
sentry, for there came a quick hail, and they
plainly heard the click of a gun-lock.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” demanded an imperative voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire! We are friends!” called out Jack,<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
lying behind a rock, for it was not at all certain
what the sentry might do.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked the other,
suspiciously, as though he imagined this might
after all be some clever trick played by German
officers, and intended for his undoing.</p>

<p>“From the lower camp, and with word for your
commander,” Jack went on to say. “So be kind
enough to summon help and have us conducted
before him. There is need of haste, too, because
right now the Turks are closing in around you,
and mean to spring a surprise attack.”</p>

<p>Apparently this startling information aroused
the sentry, for he gave some sort of signal, and
immediately afterward the tramp of feet announced
the coming of several others.</p>

<p>The boys could hear them talking together.
Then another voice, invested with more or less
authority, reached them.</p>

<p>“How many of you are there out there?”
came the question.</p>

<p>“Three, two American boys, and the Greek
guide, Arturus,” Jack replied, thinking it might<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
hurry things somewhat if he explained in a satisfactory
manner in the start.</p>

<p>“Advance one at a time, and remember that
any sign of treachery will mean your death!”
came the gruff voice, evidently belonging to a
sergeant.</p>

<p>Jack stepped out first, and quickly found himself
in the company of half a dozen men in khaki,
great, tall fellows they were, such as so many of
the Territorials seemed to be, as though they
grew giants out there in the Eastern Seas.</p>

<p>Faces were thrust close to Jack. One man
even struck a match the better to see.</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> a boy, all right!” affirmed this party, as
the match went out.</p>

<p>“We are just what we told you, two American
boys, and the Greek, Arturus,” Jack repeated, impressively.
“We must see your commander without
a minute’s delay. You are in great peril,
and the news we bring is of vast importance. Besides,
we have a letter for him from the colonel
commanding the Australian forces in the lower
camp. So please hurry up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[282]</span></p>

<p>The sergeant was apparently fully satisfied by
this time that it could not be a cunning trick
engineered by some of those Germans whom they
knew to be among the Turks. So he told them to
follow him, and ordered several of his giants to
trot along in the rear with their guns held ready.</p>

<p>Amos cared little for all this. The main thing
in his mind was that, after all, their perilous undertaking
seemed to have reached a point of
success. He only felt a cold hand clutching at
his heart occasionally when he feared that Frank
might never have been on Gallipoli after all, and
that the daring aviator whose work they had
watched and cheered was a total stranger.</p>

<p>Presently they found themselves in the camp
of the New Zealanders. The khaki-colored tents
had been erected here and there in places that
seemed to afford the highest degree of safety.
Doubtless there were also cavities in the rocks into
which the men retreated like conies whenever
there was danger of the camp being under shell
fire from some distant Turkish redoubt or
trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[283]</span></p>

<p>Straight up to one of the tents they were conducted.
Several men were sitting on camp stools,
smoking their pipes, and apparently engaged in
quietly discussing the plans of campaign that had
been laid out for their guidance, because Jack saw
immediately that they were officers.</p>

<p>The coming of the little group evidently surprised
them considerably, for they were not in
the habit of having visitors. When they did
come, it was from the fleet, bringing supplies and
ammunition, and more quick-firing guns with
which to hold the savage Turks at bay when
they fought to hurl the men in khaki into the
sea.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and where did you come from?”
asked one of the officers, evidently the commander-in-chief
of the little New Zealand force.</p>

<p>“We are two American boys who have been
with the battle fleet, sir, and sent ashore by the
Vice-Admiral on board the <em>Thunderer</em>. We were
in the lower camp yesterday and witnessed the
fight when they captured the Turks’ trenches.”</p>

<p>At that the officers uttered various exclamations<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
of satisfaction, for up to then they were
not absolutely sure what the result of the battle
had been.</p>

<p>“Our errand to your camp, sir, is a personal
one,” continued Jack; “but it can be explained
later on. The first thing we want to tell you is
that on our way here we came upon a very heavy
detachment of the enemy, leaving the old shore
road to swing around on your front. Our guide,
the Greek, Arturus, here, is positive they mean
to attack your position sometime between now
and morning.”</p>

<p>At that every man sprang to his feet. Although
they were constantly anticipating such
news, when it did come, it produced a profound
impression.</p>

<p>“Are you there, Arturus?” demanded the commander-in-chief,
discovering the young Greek,
who was evidently well known to him from previous
meetings. “Do you back up all this young
chap has been telling us?”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, General,” declared the guide.
“They are in heavy force, and mean to give you a<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
hard fight for your position. It is their aim to
drive your force into the sea.”</p>

<p>Then followed quick, sharp orders, showing
how well prepared the “Kiwis” were to accept the
gage of battle. Under arms every minute of the
day and night, ready to meet each emergency as
it arose, they were not likely to be harried out of
the position they had gained on the Gallipoli shore
by any surprise tactics on the part of the sly
enemy.</p>

<p>Presently there was no one with the newcomers
save the commander-in-chief himself. He insisted
on shaking hands with each of the three
by turns.</p>

<p>“You have done us all a great service this
night,” was what he told the boys as he squeezed
their hands. “We are always prepared for trouble,
but ‘forewarned is forearmed,’ you know, and
on this account the notice you have brought may
save many precious lives. I shall be sure to see
you later on, if alive, and anything I may be able
to do for you, that you can command of me.”</p>

<p>With that he turned and left them. Doubtless<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
he had duties himself to perform, and did not
believe in leaving every detail to subordinates.
These soldiers from the islands of the sea and
across the broad Atlantic were more inclined to
follow the French methods of kindly treating
their men than to follow the austere German or
British plan. They were on good terms with
every private in the ranks, and there was a certain
degree of familiarity between officers and
men that bound them closer together.</p>

<span id="Page_287" class="pagenum">[287]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ATTACK THAT FAILED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Left to themselves, the two boys sought a
place where they could make themselves comfortable.
The camp stools looked inviting, but cautious
Jack shook his head when Amos proposed
occupying them.</p>

<p>“I think we can find a safer place than that,”
he remarked. “Just as like as not some Turkish
spies have had a look-in at this camp, and marked
the position of the General’s headquarters. If
they have any guns along they’ll be apt to hurl
a few shells around here, and it wouldn’t pay
us to take the chances.”</p>

<p>“Whew! I never thought of that,” admitted
Amos, always ready to agree with his chum.</p>

<p>Wandering around the almost deserted camp,
they presently selected a location where they
might see something of what was going on. They
could easily understand that the position taken<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
by the Territorials had been made as impregnable
as the conditions allowed. No doubt there were
trenches and barricades behind which the troops
could work their many rapid-fire guns, and their
repeating rifles as well. Being born marksmen,
they would take frightful toll of the Turks when
they advanced to the attack in their customary
solid formations, urged on by German officers,
who from the rear would threaten to sabre or
shoot anyone daring to turn back.</p>

<p>All seemed silent save for the sound of the sea
fretting along the shore. Amos could hardly
believe that right then and there hundreds upon
hundreds of Allied troops were getting in position
to man the defences of the camp; and that
some thousands of ferocious Mussulman fighters
were creeping along not so very far away with
the avowed intention of rushing the works after
the manner of reckless fighters, careless of their
lives.</p>

<p>Amos had not forgotten the main reason for
his being there in the camp of the gallant New
Zealanders. As he sat there and glanced this<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
way and that, trying to make things out in the
uncertain light, he was wondering just where the
little level plateau lay from which the bold aviator
took his flights, and landed again after he had
sufficiently harassed the enemy.</p>

<p>It surely was somewhere close by, for unless
well within the lines he could never have come
and gone with safety. A thousand thoughts were
racing through the agitated mind of Amos
Turner, though the main theme lay in his fervent
hope that here at last he might meet the brother
for whom he had been searching so long.</p>

<p>He believed he would know the best or the
worst by the time day dawned once more. If
Frank was there they must inevitably meet; the
General had promised to do anything that lay
in his power to help. If again doomed to disappointment
the shock would prove most cruel.</p>

<p>Amos and Jack occasionally exchanged a few
sentences, but for the most part they lay there
on the ground, simply waiting to see what would
happen.</p>

<p>An hour, perhaps two of them, had passed<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
since the boys reached camp. Indeed, Amos had
actually dozed several times, so that he was utterly
unable to keep track of time. He scanned
the heavens and believed it must be getting well
on toward midnight. Would the Turks attack
soon, or had they for some reason given up the
plan? Amos even wondered whether the General
might not believe they had been mistaken
in their warning, and accordingly act less cordially
toward the boys.</p>

<p>It was while he was ruefully contemplating
some such dire possibility as this that the first
shot was fired some little distance away. Instantly
a transformation that was certainly wonderful
took place. Several searchlights flashed
into being, and criss-crossed in a hasty manner
as the manipulators sought to show up the advancing
enemy.</p>

<p>“They’ve got everything fixed, you see!” Jack
exclaimed, as both of them jumped to their feet
in their eagerness to see all they could.</p>

<p>Loud shouts were now heard. They evidently
sprang from the advancing Turks, filled with<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
fanatical zeal, and determined to sweep everything
before them, as they had undoubtedly been
assured by their German officers could be easily
done.</p>

<p>Amos held his breath. He knew what was
bound to follow, and the thought of the hail storm
of missiles that would presently be hurled upon
the attacking party filled him with dismay; for
he had seen the terrible results of such work
at close quarters before then, and would never
forget it as long as he lived.</p>

<p>That first shot must have been fired by some
advanced vidette, who, satisfied with having thus
given the alarm, had hastily retreated along lines
previously laid out for his guidance.</p>

<p>You have often heard the sudden, sharp crash
of thunder immediately after a most brilliant
flash of lightning&mdash;well, to Jack’s mind that was
about what the sudden discharge of a gun close
by sounded like, it came with such startling
abruptness.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards other sounds chimed
in&mdash;the whirring rattle of quick-firers, the volleys<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
of those in the trenches, and the stentorious
shouts of the excited men from the other side
of the world who were filled with the enthusiasm
of battle.</p>

<p>The advancing Turks also made themselves
heard, for they shouted at the top of their voices,
even as red Indians had been wont to whoop
when attacking some log cabin in an Ohio clearing,
or a wagon-train on its way across the plains.</p>

<p>The clamor grew in volume. The Turks were
firing as they came on, though those they sought
to slay were doubly screened both by darkness
and the barricades behind which they stood or
crouched, each man acting mostly on his own
initiative. The searchlights were destined to turn
the scales of battle against the charging Turks,
Jack imagined. Those powerful streams of light
playing along the enemy’s lines betrayed their
every move, and afforded the Allies a splendid
opportunity to spray their columns with the fluid
of death that leaped from the muzzles of those
quick-firers.</p>

<p>Nor was this all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the terrible noise there came
a dull boom from out on the water. Some battleship
must be there in the darkness, possibly
the same one that had so lately destroyed the
hidden battery on the shore below. The men
aboard knew to a fraction just what the distance
was, and that brilliant light showed them where
to land a shell.</p>

<p>Jack heard a peculiar sound that may have
been caused by the passage of the monster shell
overhead. Then came one of those terrible
shocks, and they could see the flash as the explosion
took place.</p>

<p>It struck him as nothing short of miraculous
how those experts aboard the battleship could
drop their shells exactly where they chose, with
darkness around them; but that was just what
happened, for the monster exploded in the very
midst of the charging Turks, and must have
created a panic among those who survived.</p>

<p>Having seen some of the craters dug by the
shells hurled from the famous forty-two-centimetre
guns of the Germans along the fighting<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
line in Belgium and France, Jack could easily
imagine what a pit had followed the crash, swallowing
scores of the Turks. But the dismay
among the attacking troops was but momentary.
They had been primed for a victory, and were not
to be cheated so easily. Once more they were
coming on, a surging mob, with the rain from
the pulsating quick-firers cutting swathes through
their ranks.</p>

<p>If you have ever watched a farmer swinging
his scythe, or the mowing machine pushing
through the wheat or oats, you can have a pretty
good idea of how men fall in windrows when a
bevy of those modern guns are in action. Those
who manipulate them constantly change the position
of the weapons so that the discharge might
be compared to the result when anyone handles a
hose to sprinkle the lawn or the family garden.
Some have even likened it to the machine for
whitewashing or painting great buildings like
those erected for Expositions; only instead of
the pure white the result of this spraying is
<em>red</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[295]</span></p>

<p>Both Amos and Jack stood there watching
most anxiously. Those shouts were so insistent,
and the clamor so dreadful that they could be
easily pardoned for feeling more or less nervousness.
If, after all, the Turks swept irresistibly
forward and carried the trenches of the Territorials,
what the result might be no one could more
than guess.</p>

<p>Both lads felt that they had much at stake in
the success or failure of the valiant defence being
put up by the men from the eastern seas.
They tried their best to gauge the rise or fall of
the tide of battle from the awful sounds that
came to their ears; but it was all such a mixture
of shouts, jumbled orders, cries of pain or savage
triumph, that this was found to be impossible.</p>

<p>Again the battleship off the coast sent another
shell ashore. This landed in the rear of the
Turks, for they were now so close to the trenches
that the British naval gunners did not dare take
the chances of harming their own allies. The
effect of the bursting shell was bound to dampen
the enthusiasm of the already despairing Turks,<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
Jack felt confident, and that counted for something.</p>

<p>Listening he presently decided in his own mind
that the ferocious cries of the assailants seemed
somewhat subdued. This might spring from the
fact that so many had already gone down under
that merciless spraying process. It was also possible
that those who were left had become disheartened,
and were by degrees giving it up.</p>

<p>When this suspicion grew stronger in his mind,
Jack felt a thrill of relief. Then, after all, it
was not going to be a massacre of the Kiwis;
they were not to be thrown into the sea, as the
Turks had openly boasted they would do when
they got ready to attend to their case. In fact,
the shoe seemed on the other foot.</p>

<p>Losses would have been incurred by the Territorials,
to be sure, for they had been subjected to
a hot fire at close quarters, besides having many
of the onrushing Turks meet them in a bayonet
charge; but the trenches had been held against all
opposition. Doubtless, too, the enemy had received
a severe lesson from this rough handling.<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
They would be more careful after this night how
they attacked the men from New Zealand. If
ever they tried to rush those trenches again, it
must be in overwhelming numbers, so that they
might carry their point through the sheer exhaustion
of the defenders.</p>

<p>“It’s all over but the shouting, I guess, Jack!”
cried Amos, when the noise began to rapidly subside,
though the terrible searchlights continued
to flash back and forth, picking out small detachments
of the retreating Turks upon whom the
exultant gunners could turn their “hoppers,” as
some of them called the rapid-fire guns.</p>

<p>“And the camp is saved in the bargain, though
we have still to find out at what cost,” replied
Jack, himself greatly pleased with the handy
fashion in which these fighting units of Territorials
had carried themselves under fire.</p>

<p>Although they could hardly expect another attack
that night, still one of those searchlights
would undoubtedly be kept busy covering the
ground above. Meanwhile the wounded must be
looked after, for there were many casualties on<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
the side of the Allies, the Turks fighting for the
trenches until many of them were literally thrown
out on the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we can make ourselves useful
again, Amos,” suggested Jack. Although greatly
wearied after all they had gone through with
since dawn, the boys could not rest easy when
there was need of their services.</p>

<p>Accordingly they sought out the first officer
they could find, and asked to be assigned the task
of helping to bring in the wounded, stating that
they had only too willingly shouldered their share
of the burden in the other camp, after the glorious
fight by which the Australians had extended
their holding on the shore. And, of course, the
officer gladly gave them permission to use a
stretcher, for as most of the troops were still
holding the trenches there was need of all the
help they could secure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span id="Page_299" class="pagenum">[299]</span>
<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FOUND AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For fear lest the revengeful Turks might seek
to shell the camp after their recent serious defeat
it was deemed unwise to use much light. Men
went about with electric hand torches, where they
had them, and sought out the wounded. Then
these were placed on stretchers and carried down
to where a temporary field hospital had been arranged,
so that their injuries might be cared for.</p>

<p>As the Territorials had for the most part
fought within the line of their own trenches it
was not difficult to find those who were in need
of tender care. Jack and Amos were surprised
at the number, for they had not imagined the
fight to be of such a desperate nature. Evidently
the Turks had attacked with their customary
dash and recklessness, even throwing themselves
into the enemy trenches to grapple with the invaders
of Islam territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[300]</span></p>

<p>There were also quite a number of gallant fellows
who would never again, alas, return to their
far-distant native shores. They had yielded up
their young lives in the great cause for which
they believed the Allies were fighting&mdash;universal
freedom from the horrible idea of militarism.
The boys felt sad when they gazed upon these victims
of the Turks’ ferocity; and deep down in
their hearts both of them fervently hoped and
prayed that the sacrifice of so many valuable
lives on both sides would not have been made in
vain.</p>

<p>They soon found themselves busily engaged.
Having already had considerable experience in
handling a stretcher, they knew just how to go
about the caring for the wounded. Indeed, it
was doubtful whether any of those among whom
they took their place carried themselves more admirably.</p>

<p>Back and forth they went, their feet dragging
a little, for they were very tired, but determined
not to flinch while another poor fellow remained
to be taken to where he could be looked after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[301]</span></p>

<p>So, by degrees, the last of the wounded had
been found out. The boys had come down with
a poor chap whom they had found trying to keep
from bleeding to death after having made a rude
tourniquet of his large silk bandana handkerchief,
possibly a last present from his girl at
home. Being somewhat experienced themselves
in the surgical arts, the boys had hastened first
of all to rearrange this, so that it would do its
work better; after which they had placed him on
the litter, and made their way down to the emergency
hospital with their burden, the man having
fainted in the meantime from utter weakness
and exhaustion.</p>

<p>There was really no need of them climbing the
rise again, for word had been passed around
that all the wounded had now been taken care of.</p>

<p>Jack could give a pretty good guess what was
on the mind of his chum when he saw Amos begin
to glance eagerly around as soon as they
found themselves amidst the busy scenes of the
field hospital.</p>

<p>“He is thinking of Frank, and the chance of<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
learning something about him here,” was what
flitted through the brain of Jack as they bore
their groaning burden toward the place where
several army surgeons were working steadily.</p>

<p>To tell the truth the closer Amos came to realizing
his ambition, which as we know was to find
his brother, the greater his fears arose. He
dreaded lest after all his long search he might
discover Frank just a little too late. The daring
aviator was accustomed to taking such fearful
chances in his chosen vocation that there must
always be heavy odds against his coming through
alive.</p>

<p>And when Amos saw the steady stream of
men in khaki being carried to the operating tables
he stared hard at each and every one as though
really afraid deep down in his brotherly heart he
was fated to find Frank there, a mangled wreck,
and utterly beyond the task of going back home
to say good-bye to the father who yearned to receive
his forgiveness.</p>

<p>Jack had an idea just then, which he hastened
to communicate to his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[303]</span></p>

<p>“Take your chance and ask the head surgeon
about Frank,” was his suggestion.</p>

<p>“I believe I will,” replied the other, not without
a perceptible shudder. “He might know of
him, for of course most of the news of the camp
is heard at the headquarters of the surgical staff.
Thank you for speaking about it, Jack.”</p>

<p>They soon found means to dispose of their
burden, and both boys were relieved when they
heard that by now the field had been well scoured
by men with stretchers, and that apparently the
last of the wounded had been brought in.</p>

<p>The Turks really behaved better than the boys
had dreamed would be the case. Indeed, many
times they heard some of the Allies speak in
terms of respect and admiration for the generosity
of the Turkish soldiers, and often bitterly
comparing it with the ferocity and apparent
cruelty they had met with on the part of others
among the Central Powers fighters.</p>

<p>So Amos, watching for an opportunity, presently
approached the head surgeon. This party
was a grizzled veteran who doubtless had seen<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
much service in his vocation, and at the outbreak
of the Great War had only too gladly placed his
knowledge at the disposition of the King.</p>

<p>He must have noticed the recent work of the
two lads at the time they bore in the wounded
Australian, for, as Amos approached, the fatigued
surgeon actually smiled and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>At another time Amos might have shuddered
at seeing signs of blood on the fingers extended
in hospitable greeting; but by now he had gone
through so much that was terrible and nerve
stretching that the experience had hardened
him to such things. Besides the boy was rapidly
becoming what might be called philosophical,
as happens to all those who are brought
in close contact with varied scenes of suffering.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve given me the chance to thank
you, my brave lad, for your assistance,” said the
head surgeon as he grasped the hand of Amos.
“I do not know who you two boys are, for somehow
you are different from our English lads, but<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
there’s little doubt your hearts are with us in this
terrible carnage.”</p>

<p>“We are both American boys,” said Amos
hastily, his eyes sparkling with pleasure at this
friendly and hearty greeting, which was so different
from what a good many Britishers would
have exhibited, for they seem to repress their
feelings until outsiders come to look upon them
as cold-blooded people, which is not the case at
all.</p>

<p>“That pleases me again,” said the surgeon,
“for my wife was of your country, and I have
spent many happy months visiting America. But
pardon my curiosity, please; what can have
brought two lads of your age over here in the
midst of the fighting, and particularly on Gallipoli
Peninsula, where one would least expect to
meet you?”</p>

<p>That gave the anxious Amos the opening he
wanted, and so he immediately started in to tell
of his long search for his brother, and just why,
at that particular time above all others, it was
of the greatest importance that Frank should return<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
home with him, even though he meant to
come back to his duty again.</p>

<p>“Tell me his name,” said the surgeon, “possibly
I may happen to know of him even if I have
never met him personally.”</p>

<p>His surprise was great when the boy proudly
let it be known that the brother whom he sought
had established a wonderful reputation for valor
among the Allies&mdash;indeed, that he even had a
price set on his head by the Germans, who had
learned to fear him above all the dashing birdmen
who served in the ranks of the French and
the British.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you astonish me,” remarked the kindly
head surgeon; “it must give you great satisfaction
to hear on every side that this wonderful
brother of yours is accounted the best aviator we
have. Far and near I have heard his praises
sung, and if any class of men can appreciate true
bravery surely soldiers may. I heard only yesterday
that he was working with us now on Gallipoli,
but as yet I have not had the pleasure of
making his acquaintance. In a way that may be<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
accounted fortunate for him, since many come
to me who would rather not.”</p>

<p>Amos was, of course, a bit disappointed. He
had anticipated meeting with better success than
this.</p>

<p>“I thank you very much for what you have
said, Doctor,” he remarked, controlling his emotion.
“We expect to make inquiries, and before
a great while I shall hope to run across Frank,
who can hardly hide his light under a bushel
here, for he will be either with the fleet at some
island rendezvous, or else on shore;” and as the
surgeon’s services were required just then nothing
more could be said.</p>

<p>Amos still lingered, not that he liked to see the
gruesome sights, but from some reason he himself
could hardly have explained had he been
asked.</p>

<p>Just then two men who had an empty stretcher
came in. Evidently they had searched in vain for
a last victim, and failing to find any meant to
give up the task.</p>

<p>One of them strode over to an army surgeon<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
who, with shirt sleeves rolled up, had been industriously
at work, though just then business
seemed slack. Jack noticed that this person was
a young fellow with a face well tanned by the air
and sun. He had a rough bandage around his
arm, which was stained by blood, and it was evident
that while wounded slightly himself he had
insisted on making use of his undoubted strength
to carry some of the boys to the hospital.</p>

<p>The surgeon greeted him as though he looked
on him as some sort of hero; for he began to
quickly undo the hastily placed bandage so as to
examine the cut made by a bayonet or flying
shrapnel.</p>

<p>Amos uttered a little cry that made his chum
turn and stare at him. He found the other focussing
his eyes on the darkened face of the young
man, while his hands were closed fiercely.</p>

<p>“Frank! oh! Frank!” almost shouted Amos.</p>

<p>At that the other whirled around and stared
at the boy, who was now advancing towards him
with outstretched hands.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_308"></a>“Don’t you know me, Frank?” cried Amos<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
hoarsely. “It’s&mdash;your&mdash;own&mdash;brother&mdash;Amos!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“Don’t you know me, Frank?” cried Amos.&mdash;<em><a href="#Ref_308">Page 308</a></em></p></div>
</div>

<p>At hearing that astounding assertion, the
young aviator looked as though he believed himself
dreaming. To meet his younger brother
here in the midst of bloody scenes, Amos, the
“kid” whom he only remembered as a little fellow,
was almost beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>But in another moment Amos had reached his
side, and putting out his arms, Frank hugged the
lad to his heart, regardless of the pain such a
movement must have caused him.</p>

<p>“What brought you over here, boy?” he demanded,
as soon as he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“Oh! we have been searching for you everywhere,”
replied Amos, beaming upon the brother
of whom he was so proud. “All the way across
Belgium, and most of the way along the lines of
battle in France, always arriving just too late to
meet you. Get your arm looked after, Frank,
and then I’ve got a thousand things to tell you.
I’m so happy I feel as if I were flying through
space, just as we saw you do when you threw
those bombs on the Turks yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[310]</span></p>

<p>“What, were you there with the Australians
through the fierce battle?” demanded Frank,
hardly able to believe his ears, for to his mind
Amos was still the same “kid” the latter had
been when he left home some years back, and he
could not realize that the boy had grown to be
so tall and stout.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we helped carry in the wounded
afterwards; but you shall hear it all, only
on condition that you let the surgeon attend
to your wound, which looks like a bad one,
too.”</p>

<p>“The only tough thing about it is I need that
arm every time I go up, and it’s going to cripple
me for some time, I’m afraid,” complained
Frank, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Then you must take a vacation, and go back
home with me, if only for a visit,” said Amos,
in a thrilling tone. “Father is nearing his end,
we fear, Frank, and he is crazy to see you just
once again before he dies. You surely wouldn’t
refuse him the last chance to ask you to forgive
him; for, Frank, what was lost has been found<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
just lately, back of the drawer in the desk where
it lay all these years!”</p>

<p>Upon hearing how his name had been cleared,
Frank seemed to draw in a long breath. It evidently
meant much to him to have that stern
father know he was innocent of the crime that
had been laid at his door. He put a hand to his
head&mdash;the army surgeon was already busily engaged
with the other arm.</p>

<p>“I’d rather wait until I hear the whole story,
Amos, before deciding,” he said, presently.
“Though I want to tell you right now I’m sorely
inclined to do what you are asking of me. With
this wound I’d be of little use here for some time;
and it wouldn’t take more than a month or so to
run over and come back. Yes, I own up that I
would never forgive myself if father passed
away, and I refused to give him a chance to see
me again after all these years. Most of the bitterness
has left my heart in the passage of time,
and if I survived this war I would probably have
made the first advances toward patching up a
peace with father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[312]</span></p>

<p>This made Amos smile broadly. After all he
had undergone, victory seemed only the sweeter
to the boy. He introduced Jack to his brother,
who, it seemed, remembered the cousin. Then,
later on, the three sought a secure nook where
the story could be told.</p>

<p>Frank listened with amazement when he heard
the many adventures that had befallen the two
brave American boys during their long continued
search for him. Many times did he stop the
narrator to ask questions. He even viewed the
wonderful paper signed by K. of K. with due
reverence; for like most of the soldiers fighting
for King George and the cause of the Allies, he
had come to believe Kitchener the mainstay of
the whole war, and the one whose tactics would
eventually win out.</p>

<p>At last there was really nothing else to say, and
Amos waited to hear Frank’s final decision. The
other thrust out his hand to his younger brother.</p>

<p>“After the wonderful way you’ve followed me
over the most of Europe, Amos, my dear brother,
it would be a crime for me to refuse your request.<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
Yes, I’ll start back home with you as soon as we
can get away. Perhaps they may show me some
few favors in return for what I’ve done, and
the road will be made easier. But remember, I
must come back again when I’ve seen my father.
There is yet work for me here, and my heart is
in it!”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words, Amos, boy fashion,
jumped up and threw his hat into the air. From
that moment, the future looked rosy. Little did
our heroes guess, when last on Gallipoli, that the
daring enterprise would be frustrated&mdash;long before
this reaches the eye of the reader&mdash;by the
steady current which swiftly flowed from the Sea
of Marmora toward the Mediterranean. It was
this current that enabled the shrewd German engineers
to float innumerable mines which wrecked
or destroyed many a battleship attempting to
force the narrow passage.</p>

<p>Jack, Amos and Frank left for England, having
been accorded a passage on a returning collier,
thanks to the influence of some of Frank’s
admirers. As has been said, no one then dreamed<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
of failure; indeed, the American aviator was entreated
to hasten back to his field of duty unless
he wanted to arrive too late and find everything
carried in a glorious rush.</p>

<p>In this happy condition we will say good-bye
to the American boys whose fortunes we have
followed through the battlefields of war-stricken
Europe. It may be our good fortune to meet
them again in the pages of some future volume;
but for the present we must be patient and wait.</p>
